How to run Suspicious classifier
cd extractHRef
sudo python3
import SuspiciousClassifier
x = SuspiciousClassifier.SuspiciousClassifier(Max_Emails_To_Read, Cluster_That_Is_Phishing (1, 2, 3))
x.set_filename(path to email files)
x.set_freq_data(folder containing frequency data, name of cluster 0 freq.txt, name of clustser 1.txt, name of cluster 2.
txt)
x.read_file()
This will output two files:
        A pie chart with a breakdown of the classification
        A csv file that has all of the emails with a high threat probability
