How to run Suspicious classifier
cd extractHRef
sudo python3
import SuspiciousClassifier
x = SuspiciousClassifier.SuspiciousClassifier(Max_Emails_To_Read, Cluster_That_Is_Phishing (1, 2, 3))
x.set_filename(path to email files)
x.set_freq_data(folder containing frequency data, [list of frequency files (e.g. "clust1.txt", "clust2.txt")])
x.read_file()
This will output two files:
        A pie chart with a breakdown of the classification
        A csv file that has all of the emails with a high threat probability


How to run email_parser.py
Have csv files full of email data in the same directory as the script
python email_parser.py
Outputs: 
        training_data directory of directories for each csv dataset that contain separated emails based on day or csv title
        senders.txt which holds all the senders (repeats allowed)
        subjects.txt which holds subject lines
        words.txt which is all of the email body content

How to run unsupervised_classifier.py (use this to train your model before using suspiciousClassifier)
sudo python unsupervised_classifier.py -{h,o,d,e} -{filepath or directory path}
options:
        -h: help option to explain the script
        -o: run on a text file containing all email content of entire dataset ie words.txt
        -d: run on a specific dataset ie training_data/{dataset folder full of parsed emails}
        -e: run on a specific email (option basically just for testing purposes, useless to overall scope)
Outputs:
        {}.png: image of the clusters
        Cluster_{0,1,2}_Features.txt: top features and corresponding scores for each cluster for this dataset
