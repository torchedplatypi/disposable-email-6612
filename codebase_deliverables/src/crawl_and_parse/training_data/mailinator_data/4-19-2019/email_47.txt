If the reasons why statins are needed and how effective they are to reduce cholesterol is clearly explained, there's a better chance that patients will stick with it."" Dr. Victoria Shin, a cardiologist at Torrance Memorial Medical Center told Healthline, ""All medicine should be personalized. Each patient comes with a special set of concurrent problems, sensitivities, and risk factors that can be determined by genetics, environment as well as lifestyle habits. It's not 'one size fits all'."" Many eligible Americans not offered statins A recent patient survey of almost 6,000 people found that nearly 20 percent of them weren't receiving statin treatment, despite being eligible for it according to American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Of those patients, 60 percent said they weren't offered the drug, and others said concern about side effects was why they refused or discontinued use. ""Updating doctors on current guidelines could improve this, but another issue is how short doctor's visits are in primary care -- perhaps there's not enough time. I think we have to do a better job in engaging physicians to have this discussion with patients,"" said Goldberg.
