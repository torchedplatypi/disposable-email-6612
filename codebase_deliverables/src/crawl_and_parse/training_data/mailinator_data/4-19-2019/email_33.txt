Re: About your summer (pics inside)
"All I can say is... Wow. Ever since we made this announcement yesterday... https://eliteguardtraining.com/egt-live ...Our helpdesk has been flooded with players who want to come to EGT Live this summer. Problem is, we only have 8 more spots available... ...And as of tonight, over 100 players have emailed us about grabbing one of those spots. So it's safe to say that when this page closes on Sunday at midnight, our EGT Live roster will be full for 2019. If you want one of the 8 remaining spots, here are 3 quick things that will boost your chances: #1: Apply As Soon As Possible (DON'T WAIT UNTIL SUNDAY!) Coach Damin and I will be reviewing applications as they come in -- and, giving priority to players who apply first. So if you want to come to EGT Live, don't hesitate. Apply as soon as you possibly can: https://eliteguardtraining.com/egt-live #2: Spend At Least 20 Minutes On Your Camp Questionnaire After you apply for EGT Live, you will be sent a questionnaire. This questionnaire will tell us more about your game -- and, your motivation for coming to camp. You would be shocked to know how many players breeze through this questionnaire with one-sentence answers (and then don't understand why they weren't accepted into camp!) If you can't put effort into this initial questionnaire, chances are you can't put effort into an all- out, 5-day basketball training intensive. So don't slack on this -- put everything you've got into it, and show us exactly why your name should be on our final roster. #3: Come Prepared -- Or Don't Come At All. Being accepted into EGT Live is only the beginning. What you do in the 4 months between now and EGT Live will determine how successful you are at camp -- and, how dramatically your game changes during our 5 days together. Make no mistake: This is an intense basketball experience. We start early... We end late... And in-between, we will shake your body, your mind, and your game to it's very core. This is not for the faint of heart, man... ...And you're about to have the most elite training team in basketball break down and then re-build you into a brand new basketball player. It's like NBA Coach Cody Toppert said to me on the first day of camp last year: ""There's nothing else like this in the world."" So once you're accepted, don't stop there: Do everything you possibly can to come into camp on August 4th in the best shape of your life... ...And we will do everything WE can to make sure you leave camp on August 9th ready to take on the world. Deal? Deal ;-) Click here now to apply for your spot today, and good luck: https://eliteguardtraining.com/egt-live If you follow the advice above, you'll have a very good shot and being one of our final 8. \- T . . .
