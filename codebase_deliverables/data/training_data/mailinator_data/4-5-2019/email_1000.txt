It devalues human life and reduces individuals to nothing more than pawns of the administrative state. **This is personal to me because my family escaped tyrannical Socialism in Cuba.** So, when I see politicians in America embrace this dangerous ideology, I can 't -- and won't -- sit idly by. _And neither should you â€¦_ A wave of House Dems have already fully embraced socialist policies. And now, Senate Democrats are angling to do the same exact thing. [**Can I count on you to chip in anything you can afford to help us fight back against these radical Democrats?**](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3980057/28469308/65062/3/) **[Yes! I'll chip in $250 to stop Socialism](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3980057/28469308/65063/4/) [Yes! I'll chip in $100 to stop Socialism](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3980057/28469308/65064/5/) [Yes! I'll chip in $50 to stop Socialism](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3980057/28469308/65065/6/) [Yes! I'll chip in $25 to stop Socialism](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3980057/28469308/65066/7/)** We can't get too comfortable. I'm not exaggerating when I say we're one election away from a Socialist takeover by those who idolize Castro and Chavez. Please consider [**donating today**](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3980057/28469308/65067/8/), and help us stamp out this dangerous ideology. ** _[ No donation is too small.](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3980057/28469308/65067/9/)_** And, 100% of your contribution directly supports engagement with grassroots conservatives like you on this important issue and many others.
