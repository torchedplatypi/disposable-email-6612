This email will arrive in your inbox every Friday and my goal is to give you news, updates, and resources to help you succeed and thrive in your online business. I have so much to share with you, but I don't want to bombard you with emails throughout the week. So, I realized that instead of sending out several emails per week I could put news, updates, and resources in one handy, helpful format. Here, every Friday, you’ll get the usual summary of what’s been happening throughout the week, as well as so much more, including products, resources I’m loving, what I (and my team) have been reading, and special deals. The Smart Digest will replace the digest email that I send out on Saturdays that contains a summary of what's been happening at the SPI HQ each week. Consider this email an ""upgrade,"" so to speak, of the digest email. I want The Smart Digest to help you work smarter, and give you tools and resources and information to help you succeed. So let me know what you think!
