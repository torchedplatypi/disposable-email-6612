"b""FILED: We're going to court to block Trump's border wall"""
"Hi Donald -- We just filed legal action to put an immediate stop to the construction of President Trump's border wall. It's part of our lawsuit on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, which challenges Trump's unconstitutional national emergency declaration. While we continue to battle the border wall in court, you can help amplify our fight: Add your name to protest Trump's border wall. https://ms.clicks.actions.aclu.org/t/gcH1AAhbaVVLxQDUDxHME5ETToa-FJbB- JYXcaaaaSYOaBOKNO4~aa?m=8_1C0A0E~amp;W=lfhbs~25x7fhbsbuT0hy.Vvf~amp;s=f~amp;4=~amp;k=PnFuzylarx5cEVM5AaTyHfmPPPOfQE7I0e52~259y98DI7jcpXE83hYDO66QMMiFlo8Eh1HWXpfpHOwBbXRmz6EpGjLRYdGS2LLmjjQllhODM9EH7~259yA6 Ever since Congress refused to give Trump the $5.7 billion he requested for the wall, he's been flailing desperately -- even going so far as to declare a fake national emergency in order to circumvent Congress and divert emergency military funds for its construction. Our lawsuit argues that the president's declaration and diversion of funds violates core constitutional principles and multiple statutes -- not to mention, it's just plain wrong. Members of the SBCC and the Sierra Club live in, protect, and treasure the lands that the Trump administration has targeted for wall construction -- lands that a border wall would irreparably harm. If this isn't the country we want to be, then now is the time to be loud and clear: Say NO to Trump's border wall. https://ms.clicks.actions.aclu.org/t/gcH1AAhbaVVLxQDUDxHME5ETToa-FJbB- JYXcaaaaSYOaBOKNO4~aa?m=8_1C0A0E~amp;W=lfhbs~25x7fhbsbuT0hy.Vvf~amp;s=g~amp;4=~amp;k=PnFuzylarx5cEVM5AaTyHfmPPPOfQE7I0e52~259y98DI7jcpXE83hYDO66QMMiFlo8Eh1HWXpfpHOwBbXRmz6EpGjLRYdGS2LLmjjQllhODM9EH7~259yA6 Donald, there's too much at stake to let Trump get away with this. A wall along our southern border would harm border communities -- and our nation -- and Trump's plan for building it would fundamentally undermine our democracy.
