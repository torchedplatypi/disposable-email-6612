b'I was floored'
Fellow Conservative, when I saw the Democrat's fundraising numbers, I was just floored. This is really really bad news.

The Democrats have _**never**_ raised this much -- _and I just read their billionaire allies have committed to HUNDREDS of millions more!_ This is an emergency, so I'm sounding the alarm. ** [Can you chip in just $25 to save the Conservative movement?](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3989082/3949481/65089/2/)** The **only** way to overcome the Left 's fundraising advantage is with your immediate intervention. Giving up now is the same as surrendering to Nancy Pelosi. I can sweeten the deal a little: if you make your contribution before midnight tonight, I have secured a triple match: [**if you put in $25, I can match it 3x with another $75!**](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3989082/3949481/65089/3/) **Karl Rove, Newt Gingrich, Dan Crenshaw and others have all e-mailed you because this is top priority. This is the most important election EVER. ** We already knew it was going to be tight -- but these fundraising numbers are threatening our plans to take back President Trump's majority. [**Help us win and get triple-matched until midnight.**](http://smtpl4.dmsgs.com/t/3989082/3949481/65089/4/) To victory, Steve Scalise Republican Whip Paid for by Scalise For Congress --- Scalise for Congress is committed to restoring a Conservative House majority and electing Conservatives across the country.
