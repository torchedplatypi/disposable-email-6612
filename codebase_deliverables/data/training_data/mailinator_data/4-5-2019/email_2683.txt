b'Announcing: Your First Rental Property'
"Unsubscribe ( https://el2.convertkit-mail.com/u/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg ) | Go to website ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/wvu2hgh57vgwzr/aHR0cDovL2FmZm9yZGFueXRoaW5nLmNvbS9ibG9n ) After three years of development, I’m ready to make the announcement. The rental property investing course, Your First Rental Property, is opening for enrollment on Monday, April 8th. Here’s everything you need to know about this course: the who, what, where, when, why and how. Who Should Enroll? \------------------ Your First Rental Property is designed for beginner real estate investors in the United States who want to buy-and-hold residential rental property. “I already own a rental property. Should I enroll?” Yes. If you own one or two rental properties, you’d absolutely benefit from this course. Many of our beta-testers already owned one or two properties and enrolled in the course in order to improve their skill set, systems, processes and critical thinking and decision-making skills. But if you hold 20-30 properties, you’re too advanced for this course. Your First Rental Property is aimed at beginners who are buying their first or second rental property. “I want to invest out-of-state. Should I enroll?” Yes. This course is designed for both local and out-of-state investors. Our only assumption is that you live in the U.S. and that you want to invest in residential rental properties anywhere inside the U.S. People outside of the U.S. are welcome to enroll in the course, and can learn the concepts and high-level critical thinking. But specifics about taxes, laws, banking and resources will be U.S.-based. For example, I don’t know the capital gains tax rate in Sweden. I don’t know the average cost of replacing an asphalt-shingle roof in South Korea. I don’t know about lending requirements from banks and credit unions in Malaysia. Our assumptions within this course are U.S.-centric. “I’d like to buy a rental property in the next 2-3 years, but I don’t have a downpayment saved yet. Should I enroll?” Yes, and congratulations on getting a head start. This is an excellent time to learn how to analyze, find and finance deals. If you start learning 2-3 years before you’re ready to buy, you’ll be super-knowledgeable and confident by the time you’ve saved your downpayment. And if you’re ready to buy a rental property soon (like this year), then this is a critical time to learn how to choose a great rental property. “I’m up to my eyeballs in credit card debt, and I don’t have an emergency fund. Should I enroll?” Heck NO!! If you are financially struggling, please do not enroll in this course. If you’re stressed about bills and you’re in a tough financial situation, this course is not right for you at this time. I’ve published hundreds of free articles on my website and more than 180+ free podcast episodes that can help you save money, earn more, start a side hustle, and get out of high-interest consumer debt. If you’re financially struggling, stick only with my free material. Stabilize yourself first. “Is there software included with this course?” Heck yeah!! One year of FREE access to a premium multifamily property search tool is INCLUDED with this course. That’s a value of $240, included free. You can check out the search tool at ROISignal.com ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/0diwh9hoewzd8d/aHR0cHM6Ly9yb2lzaWduYWwuY29tLw== ). If you were to purchase access to this, you’d pay $20/month, or $240/year. When I found this tool and saw how much it would help our students, I emailed the developer, George, and asked if he’d let our students access this tool at a bulk-discount rate. He agreed, and I decided I’d cover the tab out-of- pocket. You get one year of free access to this search tool, which helps you find multifamily properties like duplexes, triplexes and 4-plexes, as an added bonus for being a student in this course. This is one of the many, many ways that I’ve built this course to maximize the value that you receive. What’s Inside This Course? \-------------------------- The course consists of educational videos, audio, transcripts, quizzes, worksheets, forums, checklists for your business systems and processes, word-for-word scripts that you can use when you make calls, canned responses that you can use when you send emails, and direct access to me through six (6) live Q&A; Office Hours. Here’s a 5-minute video ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/d9feh0h46w503r/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9tQ29ua3VxS01yWQ== ) that explains what’s inside the course. This video is part of the Welcome and Orientation portion of the course. ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/extph7hpvw40x5/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9tQ29ua3VxS01yWQ== ) What Will This Course Cover? \---------------------------- This 12-minute video ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/deceh0h46w5ez8/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9WdGVfbXdoTUphWQ== ) explains it well. The video is part of the Welcome and Orientation portion of the course, and within this video, I discuss why the course modules are arranged in the order in which they are. When you watch it, you’ll get strong insight into what’s inside the course — and why it matters. ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/e3sph7hpvw479q/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9WdGVfbXdoTUphWQ== ) By the end of this course, you should be able to: * Evaluate properties to see whether or not they’re a good deal * Find properties that most “retail buyers” aren’t finding * Understand a wide variety of different types of financing options * Negotiate for properties with improved skill * Understand the process of closing on a property * Understand the components of a house and be fluent in “contractor-speak” * Estimate repair and renovation costs * Build a team: agent, contractors, property managers * Screen and evaluate tenants * Set up a methodical system for tenant turnover (such as move-in // move-out processes) * Understand business and tax information related to rental property investing You WILL NOT learn about: * Flipping houses * Commercial properties (such as investing in mobile homes, offices, retail space, apartment complexes greater than 5+ units) * Lease-purchase options Where and When? \--------------- The course is online-only. You can access it from any device. Enrollment opens Monday, April 8th at 8:01 am Eastern, when we’ll email you a link at which you can enroll (sign up here ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/gpanh5hd9opm7q/aHR0cHM6Ly9hZmZvcmRhbnl0aGluZy5jb20vdmlwbGlzdA== ) to receive that email!). The registration period is open for five days. Enrollment will close on Friday, April 12th at 11:59 pm Pacific. Immediately upon enrolling, you’ll receive full access to the course. You’re welcome to self-pace through the course at your convenience. However, we encourage you to move through the course with the group, so that you and your fellow cohort of students can interact in the forums, discuss the day’s lesson, bounce ideas off each other, and hold one another accountable for finishing the homework, quizzes and worksheets. The First Day of Class is Monday, April 15th. You’ll receive a video lesson, quiz and/or other prompt 5 days per week for 10 weeks. Please set aside roughly 30 minutes per day, or 2.5 hours per week, to learn the material. Graduation is Friday, June 21st. Class dismissed! School’s out for summer! Of course, you have unlimited lifetime access to the class, including all future updates. The group pacing is an option, not a requirement. You’re welcome to revisit the lessons anytime you’d like, or take the class at a self-directed pace. Many students find themselves getting off- sync with the student cohort midway through the material, usually after they get sick, take a vacation or get busy at work — and that’s normal and expected. In fact, we even have a special spot in the forums for our self- paced students. We call it “Turtle Power.” You’ll see. Why Should I Join? \------------------ To save yourself from making an expensive mistake. (I’ve made plenty of those!) You can learn from the school of hard knocks, or you can learn in an online classroom. Tuition for Your First Rental Property starts at $997, about the cost of ordering two housing inspections. It’s significantly less than you’d pay for a single class at a 4-year college or university. It’s substantially less than the fees and closing costs of just one refinance. If this class can save you from losing/forfeiting $5,000 in an earnest money deposit, or if it can teach you to negotiate for an extra $7,000 in closing cost concessions, or if it can prevent you from taking out the wrong type of loan and spending $3,000 in refinancing fees, it will have more than paid for itself. As you continue to make smart decisions about rental property investing, this course will pay for itself over and over again. If this class can spare you from buying the wrong rental property, just once, it could save you from making a six-figure mistake. We offer two payment options: a one-time payment of $997, or three monthly payments of $367 each. How Can I Enroll? \----------------- Sign up to the VIP list here ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/99bzhnhqw39dk5/aHR0cHM6Ly9hZmZvcmRhbnl0aGluZy5jb20vdmlwbGlzdA== ). We’ll send you an email with a link to enroll on Monday, April 8th at 8:01 am Eastern. (We’ll also publish the link on affordanything.com at that time.) You’ll have five days to register. Enrollment closes Friday, April 12th. Class begins on Monday, April 15th and runs through June 21st. You’ll have lifetime access, so you can revisit the lessons anytime. Let me know if you have any questions. Feel free to hit reply, or send me a direct message on Instagram ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/8dhqhoh0dp9o02/aHR0cDovL2luc3RhZ3JhbS5jb20vcGF1bGFwYW50 ) with any questions. Thanks! I’ll see you in class! — Paula P.S. “I can’t enroll at this time. When will you be offering the class again?” Hmmm. Possibly July, but more likely October. We’re not sure yet. If you don’t want to wait until October, I’d recommend enrolling now. You get lifetime access to the course, so you can go through the lessons anytime at your convenience. Once you’re an alumni, you’re welcome to join the student cohort of any future class. If you want to enjoy group pacing with any future cohort of students, just let us know and we’ll be happy to welcome you to any future class! Several of our beta-testers will be going through this course again, alongside you, so that they can experience the lessons for a second round. There’s a lot of information in this course, so it’s normal to go through the material multiple times. P.P.S. “Is there a refund policy?” Yes! The course has a 30-day money-back guarantee. If, during the first 30 days, you decide it’s not for you, let us know and you’ll receive a full refund – no questions asked. __________ Take Action! * Track your net worth ( https://el2.convertkit- mail.com/c/0vuz2rzm4h9h78meg/m7u7h5hg50e3g0/aHR0cHM6Ly9hZmZvcmRhbnl0aGluZy5jb20vcGVyc29uYWxjYXBpdGFs ). * Earn more!
