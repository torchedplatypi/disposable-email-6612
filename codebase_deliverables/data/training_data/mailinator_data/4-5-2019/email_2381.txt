b'YOUR PAYMENT'
Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Dr.Henry Thomas, I am the vice Chairman of the International Investigations and Anti Fraud Task Force, For Africa and Europe 2019, Sir, we the entire delegates of the above office has been to Africa and Europe recently because of numerous complaints filed against some banks on their inability to pay foreign beneficiaries Inheritance payments, Contracts, and Compensatory funds into their respective banks accounts even after they must have collected all required transfer fees from these foreign beneficiaries. This is the reason why we were mandated by the United Nations (US) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to solve these problems by making sure that beneficiaries receive their long over due funds fund without making further upfront payment to anyone, we have been able to repatriate some funds that was wrongly diverted into different bank accounts with the collaboration of some bank officials. Further more ,from your file here on my table I am so surprised that you have not received your payment up till this moment,from what I saw in your file you have complied with all the transfer documents that shows and proved your legitimacy as the beneficiary of this fund but all documents are now expired and not longer valid. We signed a memorandum of understanding with most of the banks in Europe and Africa to pay off all certified foreign beneficiaries from our own liquidity (Available Funds) in our UN / Europe controlled bank , and we will debit the government of each of country where the funds originate from, and recover our money from same through their government as agreed in accordance with all the agreement signed with various banks and governments. Finally, Are you still alive and healthy? If you are still alive, you are required to immediately respond to this mail and state the amount you expect to receive and send any identification document ,and some documents that entitle you to the funds, this way your file will be opened again and payment will be processed after communication is established between you and I, so that we will verify your legitimacy and then approve your payment and direct you to one of the banks we have chosen to release your payment to you. Regards. Dr. Harry George United Nations/IMF Vice Chairman For International Investigations & Anti Fraud Task Force Africa and Europe 2019.
