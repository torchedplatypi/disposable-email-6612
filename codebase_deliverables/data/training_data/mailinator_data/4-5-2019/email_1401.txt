b'New York Times bombshell '
"Dear MoveOn member, In bombshell stories in The New York Times and The Washington Post, members of Robert Mueller's investigation team are starting to come forward to counter Attorney General William Barr's summary of their nearly two-year investigation.^1,2 According to the Post, members of Mueller's team have said that the evidence they gathered on obstruction was ""alarming and significant.""^3 And a member of Mueller's team said that the team had themselves created summary information, explaining that ""the front matter from each section could have been released immediately—or very quickly.""^4 But Barr released his own summary—and is refusing to release even the summaries prepared by the investigators. Today, MoveOn members were part of a coalition that anchored 325 MoveOn-anchored events across the country. We're taking action to demand that Barr release the full Mueller report and supporting evidence. And we need your ongoing support to keep up our efforts and expand the fight. Can you chip in $5 a month to help out?

Our actions, calls, and pressure are having impact. After all, Mueller was able to finish his work. And the House Judiciary Committee voted yesterday to subpoena the report. But we still have a big fight ahead, and we cannot let up the pressure until Congress and the public see the full report. And there's a bigger fight as well: If Trump and Barr can dismiss the Mueller findings without transparency and accountability, they will be emboldened to cover up every attempt to investigate their actions—from hearings on the destructive family separation policy to probes into corruption across Trump's cabinet to the request from Congress for Trump's tax returns. If we want to hold members of this administration accountable for their rampant corruption, criminality, self- dealing, vicious abuses of our Constitution, and constant assaults on our most vulnerable communities, we need to be in this fight at every turn. Will you pitch in $5 a month so we can keep fighting for the full Mueller report, for the release of Trump's tax returns, and for Trump to be accountable for his corruption and abuses?

Our local actions everywhere across the country today were a powerful, visual, national, immediate response to Barr's failure to submit the report by the congressional deadline, and the breaking news is helping move the needle. Our ongoing efforts are helping to strengthen Democrats' resolve to use every tool in their toolbox to get the report. Indeed, Democrats voted this week to subpoena the report.^5 And we're showing national and local media that we won't give up. We're going to continue fighting for truth and accountability—via the Mueller report and beyond. We need to keep our grassroots movement going to empower Congress, the media, and others to investigate, digging deep into the corruption and criminality of the Trump administration, business, and family. If, at this moment, we step back, we're sending a signal to all investigators that grassroots people power won't back them. But by preparing to continue with more of the kind of rapid-response national actions we did today, we are making clear that rooting out corruption, uncovering the truth, and holding the administration accountable are critical. Hundreds of events took place today. Now is the moment to invest in this bigger, longer-term fight. Will you pitch in $5 a month to help us keep up the fight—and build a mandate for the release of the Mueller report, Trump's tax returns, and more?
