"BitcoinNews.com /////////////////////////////////////////// Crypto Considered to Plug Legalized Cannabis Payments Hole in California Posted: 05 Apr 2019 01:02 AM PDT https://bitcoinnews.com/crypto-considered-to-plug-legalized- cannabis-payments-hole-in-california/ Two Democratic members of the state assembly in California have filed a bill to enable legal cannabis operators in that US state to pay their bills in Stablecoin rather than fiat. The two Democrats, Kevin McCarty and Phil Ting, are protesting against US federal restrictions that are still out of tune with the legalized cannabis industry, which make the use of either cards or digital payments difficult. McCarty and Ting see cryptocurrency as a possible solution, particularly with an increase in interest in the legalization of pot in other US states. Cannabis was also legalized in Canada last year, where payment institutions are still somewhat reluctant to accept involvement. The solution, as the presenters of the bill see it, would be to change State law to enable operators to pay their city, county and state taxes and fees in stablecoin, a cryptocurrency tied to the US dollar. As the bill points out, Existing law imposes a state excise tax on the purchase of cannabis and cannabis products, as defined, at the rate of 15% of the average market price of any retail sale by a cannabis retailer. This is one tax which could be paid using cryptocurrency. With 47 US states having some element of legalization, financial services are still tied to federal law which still generally classifies marijuana as a drug; an issue which has become a entanglement such services such as card issuers are still reluctant to engage in until the law is clarified, due to the possibility of crossing the law into uncharted terrain where state penalties could be forthcoming. There are also benefits using cryptocurrency for legal purchases of the drug in an industry which is predicted to grow to USD 5.1 billion by 2020 according to California State Treasurer Fiona Ma. Under the bill, if passed into legislation, federal legislators would no longer be able to penalize banks accepting deposits from legalized operators, and equally loans to such operators could be offered as they would be to other legitimate businesses.

The data shows that Bitcoin, as a payment system, lags far behind Visa and Mastercard on several key transaction indicators, but has already surpassed its rivals in several parameters. DataLight projected that at current network growth rates, Bitcoin has already shown its potential and staying power, with established leaders in the payment system sector considering Bitcoin as a competitor only ten years since its introduction. There are currently around 25 million Bitcoin wallets already created while there are 5.3 billion Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards in circulation worldwide. The firm argues that, if adoption pace maintains, in another decade it it will surpass all competition. There were several statistics that indicated this. For example, Bitcoin already has a far larger number of nodes (over 10,000 active nodes compared to Visas 119 data centers, Mastercards 98 and PayPals 51), far lower comparative fee costs and size of transactions. Transaction/capitalization indicator allows us to examine the networks activity through the prism of market evaluation. In this case, Bitcoins indicator is higher, which leads us to the conclusion that the market evaluates Bitcoin higher than it does Visa and Master Card Bitcoins transactional volume of USD 3.4 trillion in 2018 already surpassed PayPals USD 578 billion, while its average transaction value completely dwarfs its competitors, clocking in at over USD 41,000, compared to USD 58, 90 and 80 for PayPal, Visa and Mastercard respectively. The report concludes: Right now Bitcoins payment system is much superior to the conventional international payments and wire transfers. Technical improvement of Bitcoin’s network is almost certain to make it the world’s main payment system. This is why the bear trend of 2018 will be another dip before the exponential growth and new all time highs.

With over 100 firms represented in the new project which is designed to bring developers in tandem the newly formed INATBA sees itself as a global multi-stakeholder forum aimed at further promoting blockchain across different sectors in Europe. With members such as SWIFT, IBM, Ripple, banks such as Barclays, and notables from the cryptocurrency space such as ConsenSys AG, crypto mining firm Bitfury, wallet leader Ledger, and IOTA, the new body packs a punch. The project has been an initiative in waiting for some months up to yesterdays launch in Brussels. The European Commission itself has been proactive launching its won initiatives with a similar aim to the INATBA, most notably forming the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) along with 22 member countries to support the delivery of cross-border digital public services. Also last year, the EU launched the Blockchain Observatory and Forum, also including ConsenSys amongst its membership. INATBA has laid out its specific aims as protecting and ensuring both legal predictability, and integrity and transparency in blockchain by dialogue between regulators, policymakers and participants in the industry. Also in Europe, the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAFM) has praised blockchains potential to support Europes unity at a fundamental level by improving the unions asylum protocol. BAFM published findings of its study on 26 March in a white paper, detailing how blockchain could be used in the case of identifying refugees using the immutable technology.

And now, the Supreme Court of India has moved the hearing to July. It is the sixth time the highest court has adjourned Crypto vs RBI. According to a report from CCN, RBI counsel had sought a regular day hearing which the court typically reserves for cases whose final arguments have already been submitted. It was granted by the court, and this is seen as a strong indication that this July date will now result in an outcome. The March date was apparently a miscellaneous day hearing, bunching together all manner of court cases, causing court delays in hearings and ultimately, only allowing for brief court discussion of several minutes in the congestion. This prevents plaintiffs and respondents from developing solid arguments. As it turned out, not the ideal scenario for a complex discussion on regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency businesses. The added months of delay will be seen as a temporary blow to the Indian crypto commerce sector, although it will be hoped that a final answer will be delivered, determining if RBIs initial banking ban for crypto exchanges was in fact constitutionally valid. In January, the ban seemed to have carried on towards individuals, with an Indian crypto influencers account frozen after a crypto-related transaction.

The Carlauren Group, which boasts a commitment to operating at the highest standards; with a total dedication to the people we support, has launched the C-Coin set with a GPB 70 (USD 92) price tag to match the price of one night in a Carlauren care home. The company has promised to buy back coins at a rate of GPB 63 (USD 83) to avoid any of the usual price fluctuation or volatility normally associated with cryptocurrencies. However, buying to the innovative scheme is not that cheap at a minimum investment of 1000 coins, a GPB 7,000 (USD 9,227) outlay. Maximum cap at buy-in is currently 500 C-Coin tokens worth GPB 35,000 (USD 46,150). The buy-back price was explained by the companys CEO Sean Murrey who believes that cryptocurrency will revolutionize future payments. He commented: However, I am conscious that cryptocurrencies have received a bad press recently, so we have taken extensive measures to ensure the C-Coin is the best possible safe solution for all investors. The scheme has been plugged as a kind of timeshare for the elderly, allowing families to think ahead and invest in their own care in future years. The advantage of the coins will be their tradeability as they could be listed on an exchange and sold. However, BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones argues that there could be a drawback as anyone can sign up to buy coins, with no apparent checks. The implication here, he argues, is that the scheme could attract outside investors with no interest in the care home looking to turn a profit when the 500,000 token supply runs out. The Competition and Markets Authority also warned that Requiring care home residents to pay for goods or services in cryptocurrency may raise potential consumer protection concerns. It seems that age is no barrier when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption. Last year, a center based in Tokyo, ran Japans first virtual currency investment course for seniors, with some of its students in their 80s.

According to the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which tracks a basket of the biggest tokens, the value of these crypto stocks have jumped almost 30%, well on its way to a fifth consecutive week of gains after months of subdued activity. The sudden climb for Bitcoin, which some are still wondering if an April Fools joke had anything to do with it, continued to record new highs in the past 24 hours, trading for as much as $5,315 in evening US trading before Asian markets sheared off some of those gains today.

The joy continued in Asia as Remixpoint Inc in Japan saw a 16% hike today to complete a 26% gain in four days, while Vidente Co has increased by 20% since Saturday. The biggest winner for now appears to be billionaire crypto angel Mike Novogratz, whose shares of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd is up 160% today from a year ago.
