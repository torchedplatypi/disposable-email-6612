Have you ever stopped to, like, you know, really listen to what people say in a conversation? In English, we use filler words such as ""like"", ""basically"", ""you know"", ""well"", and many more to pad out our conversation. They give us time to think, they can help us emphasise a point and gain agreement, and many other functions. Well... Spanish is exactly the same. There is even a special word for them: muletillas. A muletilla is a ""crutch"", and that's what these little phrases help do: they act as something you can lean on in your conversation. They're an important tool in our conversation kit as - used well - they add the impression of fluency. You can start your sentences with bueno, pues, or pues bueno, or bueno pues, the list goes on! We've put together a guide of 26 muletillas for you to use in your conversations, neatly categorised: [ Guide to Spanish conversation fillers ]( http://378dw.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/Zt0-D_oZONS7a0vPNLB4RTfB1y5t43-yz1tOx6htVaLjVg6cSIq2jYQs7wbGzqeG5j8tfiEqM5_Oi2jm5NPp4zM_1WN- WowhScCgA2_pS1ga0hZmlKEsJ7d77bb_nejxhUkcw3muttNNX02OjaiaLM9ko8IAe7hCTVe- FKsEyWZ1uf4lZNIKabUc2rY_cWEB-EUSB11PL24Ko45E ) In our upcoming Conversation Confidence course, we'll include a module with muletillas, as well as many, many more conversation tricks and tips to help with your fluency.
