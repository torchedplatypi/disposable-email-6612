Believe me, these are not good odds — and this is not a disease you want to mess around with. In fact, prostate cancer is the second most deadly cancer for men in America. And it’s the leading cause of cancer-related death in men over age 75. Fortunately, according to renowned holistic physician David Brownstein, M.D., you can turn these odds around just by following a few simple guidelines. Dr. Brownstein collaborated with Newsmax Health to make available a special male health video presentation, [**The 5 Early Warning Signs of Prostate Cancer**.](http://t.latest.newsmax.com/r/?id=hb1250d94,5d3c4c9,5d6c115&ns_mail_uid=265a3698-c185-4101-b695-14e11348ea88&ns_mail_job=DM22870_04052019&s=acs&dkt_nbr=010102031fsw) In this video, you’ll discover how easy it is to keep your prostate healthy, reverse an enlarged or inflamed prostate that makes urination difficult and painful, and protect yourself from cancer in this vital gland. Dr. Brownstein will also reveal how using certain prescription drugs to relieve the symptoms of an enlarged prostate can actually _increase_ your risk for prostate cancer. Plus, you will see how having too much estrogen — or too little testosterone — could not only be feminizing you, but also putting you at higher risk for prostate cancer. **The 5 Early Warning Signs of Prostate Cancer: A Newsmax Health Special Presentation** [![](http://news.newsmax.com/images/76387/75173_5_signs_Prostate_Cancer.jpg)](http://t.latest.newsmax.com/r/?id=hb1250d94,5d3c4c9,5d6c116&ns_mail_uid=265a3698-c185-4101-b695-14e11348ea88&ns_mail_job=DM22870_04052019&s=acs&dkt_nbr=010102031fsw) David Brownstein, M.D., is a board-certified family physician and medical director of the Center for Holistic Medicine in West Bloomfield, Mich., where he uses the best of both conventional and natural treatment methods.
