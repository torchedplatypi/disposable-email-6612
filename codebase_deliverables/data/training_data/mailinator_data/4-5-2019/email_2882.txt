"Hi, I'll be very quick -- did you see Manny's email from yesterday? In order to defeat John Cornyn, we must grow our Cornyn War Room right now. Can you chip in $7 to our War Room Fund? Yes, I'll chip in $7: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/e-190404?amount=7&recurring=1&refcode;=2019_April_CornynWarRoom_e2_CW In the fight, Cliff Walker Deputy Executive Director, Texas Democratic Party \---------- Forwarded message ---------- Sender: Manny Garcia Subject: re: Cornyn Hey -- big news! We just launched our groundbreaking, multi-million- dollar Cornyn War Room to defeat Republican John Cornyn. Texas is the biggest battleground state in 2020. Polling shows Cornyn is unpopular, unknown, and weak. In the race against John Cornyn, our Democratic candidate is already within the margin of error. This same polling also shows that Senator Cornyn is one of the most unpopular politicians in the state of Texas -- even more so than Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. The size and scope of our Cornyn War Room has never been undertaken in Texas history. This War Room will allow us to capitalize on our successes in 2018, and unseat Cornyn in November 2020. To win, the Texas Democratic Party must scale the Cornyn War Room right now. That's why we need your continued support. Can you chip in $7 to our Cornyn War Room Fund? Yes, I'll chip in $7: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/e-190404?amount=7&recurring=1&refcode;=2019_April_CornynWarRoom_e2_CW The 2020 election will be the fight of our lifetimes, and we're gearing up for what will be a hard-fought race to win the White House, take out John Cornyn, send more Texas Democrats to Congress, flip the Texas House, and elect hundreds of local Democrats across the state.
