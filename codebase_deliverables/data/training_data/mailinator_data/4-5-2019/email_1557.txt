"No Borders Migration Newsletter - 5 April 2019 Friday, 5th April 2019 Issue #1 TOP STORY ISSUES OF THIS MONTH Visa charges to increase under Australia's 2019 budget Australian tourism body calls for 'visa for life' for frequent travellers Eddie Kang found to have ripped off tens of thousands from international students Available Jobs in Australia Visa charges to increase under Australia's 2019 budget From the 1st of July 2019 most visa application charges will be increasing by 5.4%. The exception will be the Visitor Visa subclass 600 which will stay at the same price. Along with the increase of fees, the Australian government will be making many changes to the migration system over the coming year. These changes include: removing visas to introduce new visas, reducing the immigration intake, and changing the requirements for some visas. For further details on the effect of the budget please visit our website *here* Australian tourism body calls for 'visa for life' for frequent travellers The Australian Tourism Export Council has recommended that the Australian government invests in a 'visa for life' for regular tourists. This visa would be for international visitors who regularly visit Australia that have cleared all the appropriate security checks. The Council states that Australia is losing out on tourists who would visit Australia spontaneously because of the country's large backlog for visa processing. This may cause the tourists to go to another country with a faster visa processing system which makes Australia lose out on tourism money. The Council states Australia needs better resources to speed up the visa system. Eddie Kang found to have ripped off tens of thousands from international students Eddie Kang, who has previously been convicted of fraud, has been found to be up to his old tricks and is still conning international students out of tens of thousands of dollars. Kang is known to advertise employee sponsorship deals so students can gain permanent residency in Australia. However, once the students pay they find that the sponsored job doesn't exist and Kang never applied for their visas. Kang has run many different companies under this guise, and despite being convicted of fraud he is still permitted to run a business as long as he is not sole director. This issue highlights why it is so important that migrants do their research on migration agents before engaging them. Make sure your migration agent is registered with Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA), as this body regulates official migration agents. By using an agent who is not registered with MARA to assist with your visa application, you may be exposing yourself to migration fraud.
