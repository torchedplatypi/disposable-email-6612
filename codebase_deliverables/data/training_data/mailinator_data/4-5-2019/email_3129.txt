The strong momentum in stocks has recently been attributed to renewed hopes that the U.S. and China will come to terms on a trade deal. Now, some traders might be complaining because of the lack of volatility in the market. But today is actually one of my favorite days to trade. Why? Because it’s expiration Friday. You see, most popular stocks and options offer weekly options to trade, that expire every Friday. That said, on expiration day, an option will either expire worthless or in-the-money, there is no in-between. Furthermore, options are time wasting assets. That means on Friday’s you can find options for dirt cheap... because there is a high probability that they will expire worthless... ...but when they don’t… Profits are explosive. For example, last week I decided to day trade options on BABA and SPY, based on what my money indicator was telling me. That said, this is what I wrote to WMM clients in advance: ![Image](https://d15k2d11r6t6rl.cloudfront.net/public/users/Integrators/BeeProAgency/230861_208206/pasted%20image%200%20%2831%29%20%281%29.png) **_(You can day trade options, and Friday’s happen to be the best days to trade them.)_** Well… It couldn’t have worked out any better... ![Image](https://d15k2d11r6t6rl.cloudfront.net/public/users/Integrators/BeeProAgency/230861_208206/Image%20from%20iOS%20%2812%29%20%282%29%20%281%29.jpg) **_([Click here to receive my alerts in real-time](https://is-tracking-link- api-prod.appspot.com/api/v1/click/5108548739530752/5799306502078464) )_** ![Image](https://d15k2d11r6t6rl.cloudfront.net/public/users/Integrators/BeeProAgency/230861_208206/Image%20from%20iOS%20%2810%29%20%283%29%20%281%29.jpg) (If you need a primer on options trading, [**check out my free eBook**](https://is-tracking-link-api- prod.appspot.com/api/v1/click/6267101470785536/5799306502078464) ) Not too shabby...39% on a 68 basis points move in SPY calls… And that’s the thing. Options are priced on a probability model. Furthermore, options that are at-the-money (and out-the-money) can lose premium quickly on expiration Friday. And one of my strategies is to find these high risk-reward trades...because the payouts can be so insane. However, since you’re getting incredible leverage, and the risk is already high, I just put the tiniest fraction of my portfolio in these types of trades. That said, to get a deeper understanding of how options move on expiration Friday, [I put together this lesson on options time decay, you can view it here.](https://is-tracking-link-api- prod.appspot.com/api/v1/click/4794104318787584/5799306502078464) **To YOUR Success!** ![Image](https://d15k2d11r6t6rl.cloudfront.net/public/users/Integrators/BeeProAgency/230861_208206/9507be001f7fa5948e188ae0e2621e26.png) **Jeff Bishop ** **P.S.** \- If you have a small account and are **looking for strategies to build it up** , you should **check out what Jeff Williams is doing**.
