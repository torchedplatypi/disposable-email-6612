b'\xe2\x9e\x9c The battle continues... millis() vs delay() when creating timed events [Arduino Video Lesson]'
Hi John, This week we have another lesson exploring issues that can arise when using the Arduino delay() function. The goal of this series is that you’ll be able to program, and control independent timed events with your Arduino. Why so much emphasis on creating timed events? Well - it’s a pretty common need and super helpful! This lesson is about an issue that arises when trying to use the delay() function and also read inputs - it’s a problem! You can watch the lesson here () . () There are more lessons coming after this about setting up timed events. Once you wrap your head around how to make it happen, it adds a great tool to your Arduino programming tool box. Well, I hope you have a great weekend John! -Michael Cheich Team PEA P.S.
