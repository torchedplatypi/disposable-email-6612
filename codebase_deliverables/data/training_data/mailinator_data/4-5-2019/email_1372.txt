John Elite Hockey Prep Camp has just finished the first weekend camp of the season and it was a huge success. Special thanks goes out to all the scouts that attended this weekend from NCAA Colleges, BCHL,AJHL,OJHL,NAHL,USHL,USPHL, NOJHL,GOJHL,CPJHL, Midget AAA and Prep School hockey teams. This was our first weekend camp that we have ever done and scouts were very pleased with the caliber. It is not often where you can have Combine Testing, Skill Development, Exposure and Seminars all under one roof. Before the camp we were informed that another player from last years camp Dillon Milliron had just committed to go play NCAA Division 3 next year for Anna Maria College. Congratulations Dillon for all your hard work and your commitment to the game. Milliron played last year for the New York Aviators in the USPHL and was the Captain for the club. Coalson Wolford from the Notre Dame Hounds also won the Saskatchewan Midget AAA League for the second straight season. Both Coalson and Egan have been with our program for the past 3 summers. Next year Coalson will be playing in the BCHL for the Samon Arm Silverbacks. Just last night Elite Hockey Prep Camps received a phone call from the coach of St Scholastica NCAA Division 3 that alumni member Tyler Hinterser from the Brookings Blizzard of the NAHL will be joining them for the 19-20 season. Tyler has mist almost the entire season this year with a serious back surgery that has limited him this year. Players from this weekend went through a very intense training program. This was the first year that we introduced Sporttesting to our program. It was great for players to see how they ranked against players in the camp as well as other players that have went through the training like Connor McDavid, and Nathan McKinnon. On Ice practices went very well with several parents and players praising the practices run by our coaches. We are almost sold out right now for both Las Vegas and Niagara Falls camp. If you are interested, please sign up soon so you don’t miss your opportunity. Like I mentioned in previous emails we have been able to help place every player with the exception of 5 players over the past 3 years and we would like to help you get to the next level. We have added more video’s and photos from this past weekend. Please follow us on social media #ehpcamps @ehpcamps.
