"![](https://003e34.efeedbacktrk.com/uhfcmkgybzysdwwgsgmqjsmcbkspbwcykbdqfwzhqqgmmc_spbmbkppmtbmmcckkrjj.gif)**Elevation Worship** 's ""With You"" combines a soothing melody with intimate lyrics to remind us of the patience, trust, and contentment we're called to have in and with the Lord. The song was written to help people clear anxious thoughts and outward distractions so they can make space for what's most important: being present with God, hearing His voice, and knowing that we're loved by Him.
