Haven 't you heard that before? :) Isn't it funny how many people claim to hold the ""real secrets"" to manifesting? Consider this for a moment: Maybe -- just maybe -- there ISN'T a ""real"" secret behind The Secret. As I hinted at in my last message, maybe it's just all another way of saying... **"" Your intention sets your direction.""** Here's a little something that intrigued me: **= >[ Click HERE to watch this video](http://utenspi.us/9dknZmnCyqRQlJLi4erBUNGcOXA7cRrS7Ycwol8_z61lJBYn)** [![](http://utenspi.us/407072f68a084c3da2.jpg)](http://utenspi.us/9dknZmnCyqRQlJLi4erBUNGcOXA7cRrS7Ycwol8_z61lJBYn) This video is from Heather Mathews, and it's all about the ""real secret"" behind The Secret. Beyond the spin, this cool video actually shares a much deeper lesson about the whole Law of Attraction. I wonder if you'll see what it's telling you... :) **= >[ Click HERE to watch this video](http://utenspi.us/9dknZmnCyqRQlJLi4erBUNGcOXA7cRrS7Ycwol8_z61lJBYn)** What do YOU think?

Although he initially almost turned the series down, Gardner subsequently wrote 14 original novels and two novelizations of the films between Licence Renewed in 1981 and COLD in 1996. With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam's, the Gardner novels showed an increase in the number of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing ""pants"", rather than trousers, in The Man from Barbarossa. James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were ""dogged by silliness"", giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where ""Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher"". Ill health forced Gardner to retire from writing the Bond novels in 1996. Bond occasionally supplements his alcohol consumption with the use of other drugs, for both functional and recreational reasons: Moonraker sees Bond consume a quantity of the amphetamine benzedrine accompanied by champagne, before his bridge game with Sir Hugo Drax (also consuming a carafe of vintage Riga vodka and a vodka martini); he also uses the drug for stimulation on missions, such as swimming across Shark Bay in Live and Let Die, or remaining awake and alert when threatened in the Dreamy Bond is a heavy smoker, at one point smoking 70 cigarettes a day. Bond has his cigarettes custom-made by Morland of Grosvenor Street, mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal; the cigarettes have three gold bands on the filter. Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. The cigarettes were the same as Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball: Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day. Drugs Fleming's Bond is decidedly less fashionable than his film counterpart, and his clothing choices include a number of idiosyncrasies not readily apparent to modern readers. For example, Bond usually wears loafers (""moccasins"") with his business suits, which became common in the United States beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, but would have been unusual in 1950s Britain. He also frequently prefers short-sleeved shirts and knit ties. Smoking own favourite food is scrambled eggs."" Fleming was so keen on scrambled eggs that he used his short story, ""007 in New York"", to provide his favourite recipe for the dish: in the story, this came from the housekeeper of Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce, May, who gave her name to Bond's own housekeeper. Academic Edward Biddulph observed that Fleming fully described seventy meals within the book series and that while a number of these had items in common--such as scrambled eggs and steaks--each meal was different from the others.
