If you read this entire 90-second email you will learn the following: The exact number of calories your body needs at rest The exact number of calories your body burns through all activity How to make sense of these numbers and use them to immediately torch body fat How to trigger immediate fat loss while eating the foods you love First, a small bit of info you have to know before getting started: Your BMR is the number of calories your body burns at rest (basically, in a coma). Your TDEE is your BMR, plus all the calories you burn through work, play, exercise, and even digesting food. If your goal is to burn fat, you need to eat about 15-20% fewer calories than your TDEE to jump-start fat loss. If you want to gain muscle you need to eat about 5-10% more calories than your TDEE to force your body to grow. Based on the information you entered at our site, we estimate the following information: Your BMR is 1674 Your TDEE is 2009 What Next? Once you multiply your TDEE against your goal number (mentioned above) you need to split up those calories into an allotment of macros (carbs, protein, and fat). This will preserve muscle, burn fat, and regulate hormones so your mood is elevated and your cravings are reduced. Why? The less hungry you are while dieting, the better chance you have of reaching your goals! From there, you then only need to log your food, track your macros, and watch the fat melt off day by day. It truly is that easy: You don't have to fret about what foods to eat or avoid. You don't have to worry about when to eat, or how often. You don't have to feel guilty about eating foods you love. As long as you hit your macros, your fat loss will come at a steady and predictable rate. This is why IIFYM is such a sustainable program. We don't require that you give up the foods you love or force you to eat foods you dislike. Being able to live a normal life is the #1 reason that people succeed with IIFYM more than any other program. Let me put it in another way... What do you think would be easier to stick with: Option 1 - A diet that limits you to only 10 or so foods that are bland, tasteless, and ultra-low in carbs or fat? Option 2 - A customized program that encourages you to eat the foods you love while burning fat day-after-day? \- Which option do you think is more sustainable? \- More enjoyable? \- Easier to adhere to? The choice is pretty obvious, right? This is where IIFYM shines. Hit your macros & burn fat regardless of what you eat. Let me ask you something: Are you tired of dieting and not seeing SPECTACULAR results? Are you ready to do something that works for you, rather than against you? Does tracking macros make sense, but still seems confusing? Are you ready to trigger immediate fat loss while eating the foods you love? Without the extreme hunger and food restrictions that you expect from dieting? Without feeling guilty about giving into your cravings? And without feeling hopeless and frustrated with your body and your fat loss progress? Um... Heck yes! Who doesn't want that!? Put simply, I have done all the work for you.
