My name is Anthony Collova and I am the founder of IIFYM.com. I want to ensure that you get the most out of your macros and our programs. First, if you found us in your spam box or your promotions folder, please mark us as not-spam or drag us to your inbox so we can be a part of your journey. I really appreciate it. Whether you are new to IIFYM or are a seasoned vet, I encourage you to read this entire email so you don't miss any important details! Here are the macros our IIFYM calculator generated for you: Protein Grams: Fat Grams: Carbs Grams: Fiber Grams: When added up, your macros yield a total of calories. Eat less than this number and you burn body fat for fuel. Eat more and you will store body fat for fuel for a later date. Pretty simple, right? You selected that you wanted to lose fat, so if you eat calories, you should lose weight. One thing to consider is that even though you might hit the same calories every day, the macros that make up those calories should be set at very specific levels for you to get the most out of your diet. See, the macronutrients are the only place where calories come from in food. Protein builds and repairs muscle. Carbs provide energy and help shuttle amino acids (from protein) to the muscle. Fat helps balance hormones. This is why focusing on macros is far superior to just hitting your calories. That, and focusing on macros lets you continue to eat what you love WHILE achieving the goals you have for your body. That way - you don’t have to cook something different for the family while you eat “diet food”. You won’t have to miss out on social events, you can eat what you like (just follow the system). You can meet your goals for yourself, and start feeling like YOU again. Okay - That’s a lot of information already, so I’m going to leave it there for today. I’ll be back in your inbox tomorrow to tell you more about how you can meet your weight loss goals by eating what you love, as long as it fits your macros :) See you then!
