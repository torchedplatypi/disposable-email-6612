High quality illustrations show you set-up, how to run the activity, what to look for and what to say to the players. Sometimes the manager refers to a specific game where the training activity was put into practice giving you a picture of the end-product. This is the first time that we have harnessed the collective knowledge of our membership to create such a practical and insightful tool for coaches and I am particularly pleased that our members have taken the opportunity to get involved.
