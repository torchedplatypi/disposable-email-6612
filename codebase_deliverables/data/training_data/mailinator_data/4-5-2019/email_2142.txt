New research has discovered a way for ordinary investors to “wiretap” their trading desk… and piggyback on their incredible winning percentage and profits. [The shocking details here.](https://is-tracking-link-api- prod.appspot.com/api/v1/click/6462931452559360/6316920059985920) --- | --- | ## Mindset Advantage: Ignore the Herd --- | You don't become a TV trader because you're good, you become a TV trader because you're charismatic. Those talking heads can get you into trouble. Sure. They’re entertaining. They have a lot to say. And yes, they bring you information. But when it comes to your trading, they can cost you a lot of money. Why? Because it's their job to entertain and retain viewers - not to give you the entry or exit you really need, let alone an insight that will provide an advantage. Let’s face it… by the time it’s coming out of their mouth, the market has already responded. And when it comes to news that’s about to come out? Like today' Jobs Report - they really don’t know. So don’t let them whip you into a frenzy. Don’t take the information they provide and place a trade on it. So don't follow the herd. It may seem like the smart thing now, but it is probably headed over a cliff. --- | --- | --- | **About this eZine and Your Subscription** **Remember to share this Newsletter.** All links must remain in the article.
