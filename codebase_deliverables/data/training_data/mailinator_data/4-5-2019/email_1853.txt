"Emergency match expiring tonight. Your gift sends double the lifesaving supplies. Match your gift now >> https://donate.unicefusa.org/emergency-match- ending Friend, we're racing against the clock to send as much emergency aid as possible to children in crisis -- in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and elsewhere. Time is not on our side: every moment we wait, the deadly threat of cholera spreading from unclean water gets worse. That's why we're asking you to help today. Every donation is MATCHED to send 2x the emergency supplies, but only until midnight. This your final chance: for every lifesaving item you send, children will get two. Please, before this match expires at midnight, make your gift and send 2X the emergency supplies >> https://donate.unicefusa.org/emergency-match-ending Cyclone Idai has left children displaced and orphaned. Health centers and schools were entirely washed away. What you do today will make an incredible difference for families struggling to survive. Every dollar you give can be MATCHED, but only if you give before midnight.
