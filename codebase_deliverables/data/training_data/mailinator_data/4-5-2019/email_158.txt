Hey there, I'm very sorry with our last email about the helmet covers! When the last email went out saying we restocked our helmet covers they really should have been in stock...but they weren't and they arrived much later than I expected. I really should have adjusted when that email was sent, but I was dumb and forgot :( I have good news this time though, they are now definitely back in stock! This includes our tried and true favourites as well as the recently added designs of long hair rainbow, long hair blue and purple, and short hair rainbow. You can check out our range here! https://motoloot.com/collections/motorcycle-helmet-covers If you want one of these beauties, make sure you get in quick so you don't miss out :) Keep it real and ride safe, Chris - Founder of Motoloot.com You received this email from Moto Loot.
