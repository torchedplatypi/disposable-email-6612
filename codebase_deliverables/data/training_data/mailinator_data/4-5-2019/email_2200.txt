WITH SHAH GILANI Dear Wall Street Insights & Indictments Reader, Some folks who know me well call me ""the reluctant bull."" The moniker fits. The performance of the underlying economy does not justify the returns we're seeing out of U.S. stocks. But there's not much I, you, or anyone else can do about that. Thank our ""friends"" at the Federal Reserve for that. Their quantitative-easing initiatives are just one of the catalysts out there that have been more than enough to overcome any weaknesses. And until this balance shifts, I remain bullish, reluctantly. But you know me. I can spot the dark even in clouds chock-full of silver linings. And in the midst of this bull market, I've spotted something that disturbs me. When a CEO of a company you own takes a political stand you favor, you feel like it's an act of bravery. But if he or she takes a stand you abhor, you feel betrayed. That's how it plays in your head at least. But it's time to face the facts. Your head isn't the real world. CEOs who go on about their politics and opinions don't serve their companies' interest - or, more importantly, their shareholders' interest. In fact, they're committing malfeasance. Left or right, doesn't matter. I'm tired of it. And you should be, too. So I've put down my thoughts in a special exposé I'm sending your way right now. If you're mad after reading it, good. You should be mad.

Nor do we advocate the purchase or sale of any security or investment for any specific individual. The proprietary recommendations and analysis we present to readers is for the exclusive use of subscribers. Readers should be aware that although our track record is highly rated, and has been legally reviewed for presentation in this invitation, investment markets have inherent risks and there can be no guarantee of future profits. Likewise, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Stocks, futures, currencies, commodities, CFDs, options and all types of investment trading can have large potential rewards, but also carry large potential risks. We make absolutely no representation that gains or losses demonstrated in services published by Money Map Press LLC are likely or achievable. Please Note: Any performance results described herein are not based on actual trading of securities but are instead based on a hypothetical trading account which entered and exited the suggested positions in securities at the times and prices referenced. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results that may subsequently be achieved. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, hypothetical trading examples cannot possibly take into account the impact of liquidity or buyer and seller demand, and do not allow for slippage and associated trading costs and concerns. One must be aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in order to invest in the markets. One should never trade with money that one cannot afford to lose, and one must accept that there will be losses, and one must be able to sustain these losses, both from a financial as well as an emotional perspective.
