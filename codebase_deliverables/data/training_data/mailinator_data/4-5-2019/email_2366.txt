Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is strapped to a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, passer a la mandolin, in which the steel string of a mandolin was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents. Fleming also included four references in the novel to ""Red Indians"", including twice on the last page, which came from a unit of commandos, known as No. 30 Commando or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), composed of specialist intelligence troops. The unit was Fleming's idea, and he nicknamed the troops his ""Red Indians"", although they disliked the name. Characters Hoagy Carmichael: Fleming's view of James Bond The lead character of Casino Royale is James Bond, an agent of the Secret Service. Fleming initially named the character James Secretan before he appropriated the name of James Bond, author of the ornithology guide, Birds of the West Indies. Fleming explained to the ornithologist's wife ""that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born"". He further explained that ""When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard."" Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both the American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself, and in the novel Lynd remarks that ""Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless."" According to Andrew Lycett, Fleming's biographer, ""within the first few pages ... had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks"", which included his looks, his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits. The full details of Bond's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it ""The Vesper"", after Lynd. Bond's order, to be served in a deep champagne goblet, was for ""three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel."" Speaking of Bond's origins, Fleming said that ""he was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war"", although the author gave many of his own traits to the character. Bond's tastes are often taken from Fleming's own, as is some of his behaviour: Fleming used the casino to introduce Bond in his first novel because ""skill at gambling and knowledge of how to behave in a casino were seen ... as attributes of a gentleman"". Lycett sees much of Bond's character as being ""wish fulfilment"" by Fleming. James Bond is the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the Bulldog Drummond tales of Lieutenant Colonel Herman Cyril McNeile (aka ""Sapper"") and the Richard Hannay stories of John Buchan. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain ... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age. William Cook in New Statesman Bond's superior, M, was largely based on Godfrey, Fleming's NID superior officer; Godfrey was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament. One of the likely models for Le Chiffre was the influential English occultist, astrologer, mystic and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley, on whose physical features Fleming based Le Chiffre's. Crowley's tastes, especially in sado-masochism, were also ascribed to Le Chiffre; as Fleming's biographer Henry Chancellor notes, ""when Le Chiffre goes to work on Bond's testicles with a carpet-beater and a carving knife, the sinister figure of Aleister Crowley is there lurking in the background.
