The results show the bar has clearly been rising for these products. Nineteen comparable products were presented in the Security Value Map™ (SVM) out of 21 tested products. These products were examined for security effectiveness and total cost of ownership (TCO). Products from the following 14 market-leading vendors achieved a Recommendedrating: Bitdefender, Carbon Black, Check Point, Cisco, Cylance, Endgame, enSilo, Fortinet, Kaspersky Lab, Malwarebytes, Panda Security, Sophos, Symantec, and Trend Micro.

Network security is essential in a data center architecture to ensure the availability and security of the protected network. Several types of device provide network security for the data center, of which the data center firewall (DCFW) and the data center intrusion prevention system (DCIPS) are the most well-known. A third type of device combines the capabilities of the DCFW and DCIPS and is referred to as a data center security gateway (DCSG).

New Group Test Announced http://www2.nsslabs.com/e/46762/d-analytics-systems- group-test/72zd1t/1461196092?h=Wt6UEl0uMnyUx55_GkqZR82kZTh0WcpdlO8dIwUvcU4 NSS Labs is developing a Threat Detection and Analytics Systems (TDA) Group Test. TDA products improve the incident responder’s ability to rapidly assess and identify threat activities that incorporate subtle and advanced attack techniques, which can bypass individual security controls unless examined across the attack sequence. The TDA Group Test will help enterprises evaluate whether to replace or refresh existing breach detection system deployments with TDA products or investigate new approaches that incorporate analytics and advanced feature sets. The TDA Test Methodology is currently under review.
