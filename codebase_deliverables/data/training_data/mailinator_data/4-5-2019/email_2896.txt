Available at iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, Google Play and more digital and streaming outlets everywhere, the new song comes from Planetshakers new five- song EP _**Rain Part 2,**_ out April 12 _ **.**_ The song, which is led by Joth Hunt (who also produced and mixed the EP), declares that God is the one to look to, no matter what the circumstances. This theme is further carried in the Hunt-led ""Only Way"" single, which released last month, is featured on the new EP and became an encouragement to this multi-talented worship leader through his battle with cancer. ""God had me write that song a week before I knew this was going to happen. It was the perfect tool God helped me to use to declare victory over the situation,"" says Joth, adding, ""It's easy to sing these songs week-to-week, but when you are actually going through it, these lyrics become moreâ€¦they become an anthem.""
