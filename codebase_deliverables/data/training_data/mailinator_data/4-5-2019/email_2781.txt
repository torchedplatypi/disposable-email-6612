An air-source heat pump is one of the most efficient heating and cooling systems currently available. There are many variations of this technology on the market. An air-source heat pump works by taking the heat out of the air, even when outdoor temperatures fall below zero, and then moves it as hot refrigerant through a small pipe to one or more indoor units that deliver heat into the house. In the summer the process is reversed. An air-source heat pump removes heat from the home (even when temperatures get above 100Ëš) and delivers cold refrigerant to the indoor units. Which system provides the most comfort for you in your home at the lowest... --- | --- | --- | [![Custom Modular Building](https://d1yoaun8syyxxt.cloudfront.net/basicsalesdemo-390184d3-8b6c-4c03-8f16-e3e42db4d541-v2)](https://is- tracking-link-api- prod.appspot.com/api/v1/click/5634492717858816/6098031581593600) --- | --- | [![Facebook](https://javascript_library.s3.amazonaws.com/bard/ic- facebook.png)](http://www.facebook.com/ExpressModular/) [![Twitter](https://javascript_library.s3.amazonaws.com/bard/ic- twitter.png)](http://www.twitter.com/expressmodular) [![YouTube](https://javascript_library.s3.amazonaws.com/bard/ic- youtube.png)](http://www.youtube.com/expressmodular) [![Google+](https://javascript_library.s3.amazonaws.com/bard/ic-google- plus.png)](https://plus.google.com/+Expressmodular) [![Pinterest](https://javascript_library.s3.amazonaws.com/bard/ic- pinterest.png)](http://www.pinterest.com/expressmodular) [![Instagram](https://javascript_library.s3.amazonaws.com/bard/ic- instagram-2.png)](http://www.instagram.com/expressmodular) --- | [Unsubscribe](https://hx185.infusionsoft.com/app/linkClick/49426/47688f1c2157b175/44593544/e7949bed4f97ef95) Express Modular 1586 Winchester Ave Martinsburg, West Virginia 25405 United States (800) 275-7532 --- ![](https://is-tracking-pixel-api- prod.appspot.com/api/v1/render/4758721167228928/5990135688593408)
