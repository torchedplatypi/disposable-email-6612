"_""You're no one. You don't know anyone. You don't have any money, I'm not representing you.""_ Amy Lyle let the lawyer's sentence hang in the air for a few seconds. She had spent months on this comedy screenplay. Maybe years. She had connected with this lawyer through a friend. That friend warmed up the call. Having done everything right, Amy had felt fairly confident about her chances. Had felt. Until three sentences shattered her. _""I'm not going to lie,"" Amy replied after a while. ""That makes me really f**king sad.""_ The lawyer just laughed. * * * What was it, exactly, Amy had done so wrong? After the devastating conversation, she was bold enough to go back and ask. _""I'll give you some free advice,"" the lawyer said. ""You need to get on the map. When I search your name on Google, something better come up related to comedy.""_ So what did Amy do? She wrote a book. _The Book of Failures_ , her first effort, immediately became an Amazon Best Seller. All of a sudden, calls came in from across the country of people wanting her to host their events. She accepted everything from comedy clubs to black-tie galas. Over the years, her best seller status on Amazon remained, her following grew, and Amy enjoyed all the glories of author-dom. Oh, and the lawyer called her back. She's getting her movie made. * * * When I surveyed my audience, 80% of you said you wanted to write a book. I think that's a smart move, no matter your other goals. That's one of the reasons I've made the decision to focus my work on book- writing this month. Another reason I recently signed a publishing deal for my third book. In the elation that followed, I realized my books made me the success I am today. I now firmly believe **_everyone_** should write a book. The truth is, most media today is seen and forgotten in a matter of moments. Yes, blog posts are nice, but books have a sense of permanence to them. When are the author of a book, that means something. In a world of distraction, your book can offer you a bit of distinction. My books - _The Creative's Curse_ and _The Unstoppable Creative_ both opened doors for me. As a matter of fact, they are the only reason I recently found myself sprinting through the rain in London with a millionaire. But that's another story for another time.

Kondo made waves in Japan by releasing this book in 2011, long before her presence in the United States was ever heard or felt. Before reaching American audiences, Kondo's book earned her a television dramatization, multiple spots on Japanese talk shows, and a country-renowned video series on folding. The English translation launched October 2014, and Kondo has enjoyed a resurgence of popularity in the States, up to and including her series on Netflix. Here's where it gets fun. Kondo now certified others in her branded method of organization - the KonMarie method. The pricetag? [At least $2,700 for the training ](http://link.n.convertkit.com/wf/click?upn=39lHgDE0zQlBge-2B1NETGgFLRghiZWCFw1gMbp5iGKFzQ6T9qmpRbGicUXxbry4yNIs-2Bg0sva4lwwXImJ25V6uSR8RhGkMpHmYdHbROjI3nBY9rj307n84ryeNZHQoRdktMBa8l5d0XCoK-2FALWgXLNxBK4gsUP1O-2Fin8zJiaCPOz7WZhQN5RexlE0NH5pNk9MYkkayZyN19jOB3EOEbMQgunNSx6eAxiqqflzX8dtdZRM5MntVRyNjB1lbfmitawVeSCTt0m4uzzrxbzR3pHkRqwB97qG7VtG7glfIa7Ggd7GCAR7lk-2B4Vl5N9l38fco-2B_awaQmxv-2F1nJZcSAlC7wSQ-2B2RPrm7mxISAiZnMjLSWLqj5CynMIoHJspxxKQt-2FwTIV5Lm5Ww-2FV5eEWeV-2BHnTgDkAP2PLwCrJNZ8FC5yq2w9O9BzVQsvRiaOUiglztF-2BkmSorHyt2SDhcJUNvaJCkU8hsumboqsjlOr-2B81QC26ZzcL-2BN7bqYx-2BMIQ91fGmqh3tGSgAIhXtkeBlF98Byu2GnYezYd9w9xeOhhF7BQV8gt1pYbY5ePMQMgWoUxmRD4i40zdtThBOXnmqdTlQEX7B4QqKzC0OHNUUvve1QS-2Bx4f7MsR7phCiy5B-2BiTTVmuDwBpeuayN4rYfUll6V7zlFndFSSZPYU48VIMVt4-2BJ0DFeauXChzijGl1WZHeGM4rNq-2FvB-2Fdau4BCIKTTaQjqDJIDKxJUE8I87dv7FJhigpZ121VgSQhxXXSdKGlgtWPtQU1g6SKNz-2FsD3Bkf0wbB-2BPx-2BQrQ0ixQ-2BUctSgI5PUfUWaZCbdb4N41a4Eyt2dpF5xV5JT-2FVz5Rte5MPoAPoqqAEZQ6Q-2BBg-2F3ZSXOjsf9CuwUlszoHXSbkTfwZ3kRNTvjuDwqprqTjKvdf4r6WmoBsReZw-3D-3D)and $500 to stay certified. * * * #### Nathan Berry If you know of Nathan Berry, it's likely because of his breakthrough email software - Convert Kit. Long before he became the CEO of every creative person's favorite email tool, though, he jump-started his career with a series of books: _The App Design Handbook_ and _Designing Web Applications_. He then leveled up by writing a 3rd book - _Authority_. I can't explicitly say the books caused the success of Berry's software service… but they couldn't have hurt. [Convertkit made $13.9 million in revenue in 2018](http://link.n.convertkit.com/wf/click?upn=39lHgDE0zQlBge-2B1NETGgFLRghiZWCFw1gMbp5iGKFzQ6T9qmpRbGicUXxbry4yNwiMh0YNN0TUPTX0cHc4a8Ctufby76QSxSrYR3cS-2BmKM-2Bm4bR6Pmtf7Mc3LQvUCV8CX2duwtRrNfhHfdGUUE9uA-2FsqaoXoAPiRFeLamfYv4k-3D_awaQmxv-2F1nJZcSAlC7wSQ-2B2RPrm7mxISAiZnMjLSWLqj5CynMIoHJspxxKQt-2FwTIV5Lm5Ww-2FV5eEWeV-2BHnTgDkAP2PLwCrJNZ8FC5yq2w9O9BzVQsvRiaOUiglztF-2BkmSorHyt2SDhcJUNvaJCkU8hsumboqsjlOr-2B81QC26ZzcL-2BN7bqYx-2BMIQ91fGmqh3tGSgAIhXtkeBlF98Byu2GnYezYd9w9xeOhhF7BQV8gt1pYbY5ePMQMgWoUxmRD4i40zdtThBOXnmqdTlQEX7B4QqKzC0OHNUUvve1QS-2Bx4f7MsR7phCiy5B-2BiTTVmuDwBpeuayN4rYfUll6V7zlFndFSSZPYU48VIMVt4-2BJ0DFeauXChzijGl1WZHeGM4rNq-2FvB-2Fdau4BCIKTTaQjqDJIDKxJUE8I87dv7FJhigpZ121VgSQhxXXSdKGlgtWPtQU1nLArUmp6sZnZv1WF8SkBZiJ62R4eaFdhlkVJL-2BF61sJByzo4N7lEQ-2BGl-2BAoqGfWraEzJB05phoyShoLtsiVJkpPmPIZJZERnwMBCduvMVYTSqdTga29EO3wd2eCl2mEtder31Ih1az916BGhrq0gOg-3D-3D). Not bad for a guy who started out writing books only a programmer could love. * * * #### Eric Thomas If you are a speaker, you can get paid reasonably well. If you are a speaker with a BOOK, well, that's another ballpark entirely. If you ask Thomas and the team, the business really started rolling whenever they were finally able to get the book published. Thomas started selling copies of _The Secret to Success_ , his story spread, and now he is an international speaker, boasting clients with the NFL, NBA, and NCAA. Eric Thomas (or ET the Hip Hop Preacher) now charges anywhere up to $100,000 to speak at corporate events. Not bad for a guy who used to be homeless. * * * #### ""Julia"" A former client of SmartBlogger who prefers her last name and business details to not be released, Julia runs a coaching business for C-Level Executives. That means if you're in a corner office, Julia has her eye on you. But how does she break down the walls of these elite positions and get her foot in the door? You guessed it, a book. According to SmartBlogger, Julia's book is barely 120 pages. However, the topic is tailor fit to information every executive can be interested: The strengths and weaknesses of different leadership styles. The book gets her in the door. The coaching deals get her anywhere from $50,000 - $80,000 per engagement. * * * #### Dale Carnegie Nope, not _that_ book. Although most people are unaware of this fact, Carnegie's first book was called "" _Art of Public Speaking_."" You can see he had progressed a little with his titles by the time he broke the market down with _How to Win Friends and Influence People._ Before he was winning friends, Carnegie used that first book to drive interest in his public speaking courses. When the book was doing its best and registration for those courses really started to pick up, Carnegie started raking in $500 dollars a week ($12,500 in today's dollars) _Win Friends_ simply extended the success he was already feeling, catapulting Carnegie into a category untouched by most authors - 31 million copies sold by the time of his death. Dale Carnegie Institute still runs strong today largely on the back of this one book's performance. * * * #### James Altucher Altucher became a millionaire as a web wunderkind of the 1990s and early 2000s. Then, he lost everything. At least it gave him something to write about. After crashing and burning on Wall Street, Altucher found a home as a well- respected and admired author. His Choose Yourself series became self-published Wall Street Bestsellers. Altucher gained considerable attention by telling the world exactly how he achieved such a thing. Altucher has launched online courses, a private newsletter, a successful podcast, and of course, more books from the success of his writing. * * * #### Declan Wilson Walking back down the popularity scale a little bit, Declan Wilson is a business owner who ALSO started with a book. His blog and book — _The Millennial Way_ — launched in 2016 and gained a lot of traction when Declan decided to give away the audio book free of charge. Declan used his success there to quit his job and start his own business — _Brick NClick_ — which performs website services for overwhelmed service-based businesses. The lean operation funds his family adventures as a stay-at-home father of two. * * * #### Ash Ali and Hasan Kubba Ash is a serial tech entrepreneur with several sold companies under his belt. Hasan is a startup strategist, leveraging experience running his own digital agency and creating a consistent stream of passive income. Despite this massive success, they ran into a problem as they prepared to launch their startup training and mentorship business - NOBODY knew who they were. Now, The Unfair Advantage is set to launch this August from a big-time publisher, and potential mentees are knocking on their doors every day. * * * On Monday I asked you to dream about where a book could take you. Now, I want to ask a more practical question: _**What book could you write to move toward what you want?**_ Fill in this blank: Writing a book could help me do ___________ Please do not read that question, think about it for a few minutes, and then move on with your day. This is actual homework. Write down 10 possible books which would establish you as an expert. Start this exercise….now. :) [For bonus point, head over to the medium post and put your responses in the comments!](http://link.n.convertkit.com/wf/click?upn=39lHgDE0zQlBge-2B1NETGgFLRghiZWCFw1gMbp5iGKFzQ6T9qmpRbGicUXxbry4yNYGB1Lp3sNfOi0yJoKqsm7lS-2BPr69Rep7VoyKkaNVWijrhGR7mvfMDUr3JrbB9F3eSkObSqCmB9XWGndWNB0MTwwDsOnUBLwSn8H2Q4fy4gDPK6VKb3b2CvbCuItt0P906Vlak30LU4-2BLabS-2FhI-2F9HgrGCGs6PF7iDWfo05lhxl2-2FPPO49tu1mGs-2BorGq6u3ozPzSEnLNvF5AAlHTAlEUBYEb4HF8rBZ45IQsxw4IVUytrttBpHX0Ujp39sAIJm13VT1yNRX6X8q1EUMBoGJSPbbi-2Fj8ZP-2Fp94c0b33zy7UQ-3D_awaQmxv-2F1nJZcSAlC7wSQ-2B2RPrm7mxISAiZnMjLSWLqj5CynMIoHJspxxKQt-2FwTIV5Lm5Ww-2FV5eEWeV-2BHnTgDkAP2PLwCrJNZ8FC5yq2w9O9BzVQsvRiaOUiglztF-2BkmSorHyt2SDhcJUNvaJCkU8hsumboqsjlOr-2B81QC26ZzcL-2BN7bqYx-2BMIQ91fGmqh3tGSgAIhXtkeBlF98Byu2GnYezYd9w9xeOhhF7BQV8gt1pYbY5ePMQMgWoUxmRD4i40zdtThBOXnmqdTlQEX7B4QqKzC0OHNUUvve1QS-2Bx4f7MsR7phCiy5B-2BiTTVmuDwBpeuayN4rYfUll6V7zlFndFSSZPYU48VIMVt4-2BJ0DFeauXChzijGl1WZHeGM4rNq-2FvB-2Fdau4BCIKTTaQjqDJIDKxJUE8I87dv7FJhigpZ121VgSQhxXXSdKGlgtWPtQU1LbmJst8EI4BUuNoI6EWz9yOsd1LXX5cJAj-2FIqiuAGYgGdtJCVTxI0O9GFU52c1Q44H0Td3BTW2lNMVhaREAipghz5N97QPpDWfvp41pyWZPM-2F6ZkMfX8d6GcwaQ3ytAom5KJZroLkQ63iVgWhZvJXg-3D-3D) Much love as always <3 \- Todd B You're receiving these emails because you understand how powerful ideas are in this new world.
