Click: https://www.rivercruise.com/white-list.cfm to find out how! Dear Rev. Butler, In this newsletter, I'd like to tell you about **America's best rivers for cruising**. Sailing these waterways is a carefree and enjoyable way to experience the country's rich heritage and scenic beauty, and Vacations To Go offers every discount, deal and special promotion available for these trips. To see all the latest deals and a complete list of itineraries, just click the applicable link. Board a comfortable ship and cruise the [Mississippi River](https://www.rivercruise.com/mississippi_river.cfm?nr=mm1r_Y0a), which winds its way from northern Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. On the Upper Mississippi, you can visit Mark Twain's hometown of Hannibal, Missouri, and explore the arts scene in Red Wing, Minnesota. During the fall, see brightly colored autumn foliage. On the lower half of the river, experience Southern hospitality as you tour beautifully restored mansions, like Oak Alley in Louisiana, and dine on world-famous cuisine in New Orleans' French Quarter. The largest tributary of the Mississippi River, the [Ohio River](https://www.rivercruise.com/ohio_river.cfm?nr=mm1r_Y0a) was a major transportation route for Native Americans, European explorers and settlers. Sailings can include Henderson, Kentucky, once home to naturalist and painter John James Audubon; keep an eye out for the 12 bronze bird statues around town, plus one of Audubon. In Paducah, Kentucky -- where the Ohio meets the Tennessee River -- the galleries of the LowerTown Arts District are big draws. Madison is on the Indiana Wine Trail, and Louisville, Kentucky, is known for its horse-racing heritage. Ohio River itineraries can include segments on the Mississippi River. The [Tennessee River](https://www.rivercruise.com/tennessee_river.cfm?nr=mm1r_Y0a) covers four states, flowing from east of Knoxville, Tennessee, to Paducah, where it converges with the Ohio River. During the Civil War, Union troops strategically used the river to invade Confederate territory, leaving behind a notable list of Civil War sites. Tennessee River itineraries can make time for the Shiloh National Military Park south of Savannah, Tennessee, and the W.C. Handy Home & Museum in Florence, Alabama, where the ""Father of the Blues"" was born in 1873. Head west to the [Columbia River](https://www.rivercruise.com/columbia_river.cfm?nr=mm1r_Y0a) in Oregon and Washington and follow in the footsteps of famed explorers Lewis and Clark. Itineraries also incorporate sights on the Snake River. These trips offer opportunities to see the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, the Columbia River Gorge and Hells Canyon. Tour the Bonneville Dam, a National Historic Site whose construction started in 1934, or take in the floral splendor of the International Rose Test Garden in Portland. Typically combined into one trip, these two rivers offer an abundance of history and natural beauty. The [Hudson River](https://www.rivercruise.com/hudson_river.cfm?nr=mm1r_Y0a) flows from the Adirondack Mountains to New York City. A cruise provides the perfect way to experience all that New York has to offer, from breathtaking scenery and grand architecture to the art, history and culture of the Big Apple. Famous landmarks include Sleepy Hollow, Franklin D. Roosevelt's Springwood estate in Hyde Park and West Point Military Academy. Fall sailings showcase the region's brilliant foliage. Hudson River cruises also can venture along the Erie Canal and the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers. Spanning 363 miles across New York State, the [Erie Canal](https://www.rivercruise.com/erie_canal.cfm?nr=mm1r_Y0a) was built with 35 locks to connect Lake Erie to the Hudson River. Considered an engineering marvel, the canal attracts tourists with its charming waterfront communities. Our Erie Canal departures also include time sailing other bodies of water, such as one or more of the Great Lakes, the Hudson and the St. Lawrence River and Seaway. * * * Here are this week's **Top 20 River Cruises**.
