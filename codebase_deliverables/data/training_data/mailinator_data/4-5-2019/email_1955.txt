The Italian invasion in October 1940, which is usually known as the Greco-Italian War, was followed by the German invasion in April 1941. German landings on the island of Crete (May 1941) came after Allied forces had been defeated in mainland Greece. These battles were part of the greater Balkan Campaign of Germany. --- Hi, If you haven't tried this drink yet, you're going to want to add this to your morning routine [**Drinking 1 cup of this delicious hot beverage in the morning**](http://backetsa.us/EJU_b7s359680rBkbkNVYs5PxmZQtX9Z_zLM93BRA- MzUV15) sets you up to burn more fat than 45 exhausting minutes on the treadmill.

Have an amazing week! Aline Following the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940, Greece repulsed the initial Italian attack and a counter-attack in March 1941. When the German invasion, known as Operation Marita, began on 6 April, the bulk of the Greek Army was on the Greek border with Albania, then a protectorate of Italy, from which the Italian troops had attacked. German troops invaded from Bulgaria, creating a second front. Greece had already received a small, inadequate reinforcement from British, Australian and New Zealand forces in anticipation of the German [![Unlist Here](http://backetsa.us/98a89f5616a748e775.jpg) ](http://backetsa.us/Ohx4yzGgJXDrsApAcH2aaostgIMXOoMJqG6Ax35zh5A89kZH) (c) As used in this section, the term ""national of the United States"" has the meaning given such term in section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(22)). The Hostage Taking Act is a subsection of the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. It became enforceable in the United States January 6, 1985. Other use In old Germanic peoples the word for ""hostage"" (gÄ«sl and similar) sometimes occurred as part of a man's name: Äadgils, Cynegils, GÄ«slheard, GÄ«slbeorht, etc.; sometimes when a man from one nation was hostage in another nation, his position as hostage was more or less voluntary: for example the position of Æscferð son of EcglÄf, who was a Northumbrian hostage in Wessex; he fought under ByrhtnÅð against Vikings in the Battle of Maldon on 10 August 991 AD (ref. lines 265 etseq), and probably died in battle there. See also Homeric Question, as Greek `Ομηρος means ""Homer"" and also ""hostage"". (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, whoever, whether inside or outside the United States, seizes or detains and threatens to kill, to injure, or to continue to detain another person in order to compel a third person or a governmental organization to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the person detained, or attempts or conspires to do so, shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life and, if the death of any person results, shall be punished by death or life imprisonment. (b)(1) It is not an offense under this section if the conduct required for the offense occurred outside the United States unless-- (A) the offender or the person seized or detained is a national of the United States; (B) the offender is found in the United States; or (C) the governmental organization sought to be compelled is the Government of the United States. (2) It is not an offense under this section if the conduct required for the offense occurred inside the United States, each alleged offender and each person seized or detained are nationals of the United States, and each alleged offender is found in the United States, unless the governmental organization sought to be compelled is the Government of the United States. Sometimes the word ""hostage"" is used metaphorically, for example: ""The school did not buy the land because its headmaster missed the train to the meeting because of a road traffic accident; the whole matter thus proved to be hostage to one misbehaving carriage horse."" Dutch law In Dutch law the state can take people 'hostage' (gijzeling in Dutch) to force people to appear in court or (in civil cases) if the person refuses to pay his or her debts. In the latter case, the person in question is imprisoned one day for each €50 that are owed without cancellation of the debtA belligerent (lat. bellum gerere, ""to wage war"") is an individual, group, country, or other entity that acts in a hostile manner, such as engaging in combat. Belligerent comes from Latin, literally meaning ""one who wages war"". Unlike the use of belligerent as an adjective to mean aggressive, its use as a noun does not necessarily imply that a belligerent country is an aggressor. In times of war, belligerent countries can be contrasted with neutral countries, and non- belligerents. However, the application of the laws of war to neutral countries and the responsibilities of belligerents are not affected by any distinction between neutral countries, neutral powers or non-belligerents -- a non- belligerent may nevertheless risk being considered a belligerent if it aids or supports a belligerent in a way that is proscribed by neutral countries. An interesting use of the term arose during the American Civil War, when the Confederate States of America, though not recognized as a sovereign state, was recognized as a belligerent power; and, as a consequence, Confederate warships were given the same rights as US warships in foreign ports [![](http://backetsa.us/ee88cafdefdff7e676.jpg)](http://backetsa.us/QK6CkqFSnyBzfbCM0B5m7LfIVnB8TJ6prm1tVvxspOQgGVjJ) "
