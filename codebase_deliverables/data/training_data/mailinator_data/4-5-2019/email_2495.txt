b'High Blood Pressure in 50s Leads to Dementia'
"‌ ![](http://news.newsmax.com/images/123124/26502_trans.gif) | | **Breaking News from Newsmax.com** --- **High Blood Pressure in 50s Leads to Dementia** Elevated blood pressure in your 50s might raise your risk of developing dementia later in life, a new European study has found. People with a systolic blood pressure of 130 or more at age 50 were 45 percent more likely to be struck by dementia than people with lower blood pressure at the same age, researchers reported. **Special:**[ **Heart Surgeon's Secret to Healthy Blood Pressure**](http://t.latest.newsmax.com/r/?id=hb0bd6a81,5d3cf52,5d3ea28&ns_mail_uid=3420339f-0929-45e8-ac85-ac75c22b145d&ns_mail_job=DM22883_04052019&s=acs&dkt_nbr=0101022kqi6b) That means that blood pressure considered on the high end of ""normal"" actually could do long-term damage to your brain, said study author Jessica Abell. She's a postdoctoral research fellow at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, in Paris. ""There is plenty of evidence to suggest that maintaining a healthy blood pressure in middle age is important for both your heart and your brain later in life,"" Abell said. But the study only showed an association between high blood pressure and dementia risk, it didn't prove cause and effect. Until recently, a systolic blood pressure of 140 had been considered the level at which high blood pressure (""hypertension"") began. In fact, that's still the guideline in Europe, Abell noted. But leading American heart health organizations lowered the high blood pressure threshold to 130 in 2017, based on medical evidence showing that people with blood pressure in the 130-139 range carry a doubled risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure. The new U.S. threshold could help protect the brains of the middle-aged, Abell said. Abell, who is also a research associate in dementia and epidemiology at University College London, and her team tracked the blood pressure and brain health of over 8,600 British civil servants from 1985 onward. The investigators focused specifically on the association between blood pressure and dementia risk at age 50, 60, and 70. The researchers found that people at age 50 had an increased risk of dementia later in life if their systolic pressure was higher than 130. Systolic pressure is the pressure in your blood vessels during a heart beat. It is the top number in a blood pressure reading. According to Abell, the findings did not show an increased risk at age 60 or 70. High blood pressure has been linked to silent mini-strokes in the brain, damage to the brain's white matter, and restricted blood supply to the brain, she explained. The researchers ""saw an increased risk of dementia for those who had been exposed for longer,"" Abell said. ""Our analysis suggests that the importance of mid-life hypertension on brain health is due to the duration of exposure."" **Coronary Heart Disease:**[ **5 Tips to Reduce Your Risk**](http://t.latest.newsmax.com/r/?id=hb0bd6a81,5d3cf52,5d3ea29&ns_mail_uid=3420339f-0929-45e8-ac85-ac75c22b145d&ns_mail_job=DM22883_04052019&s=acs&dkt_nbr=0101022kqi6b) [**The One Thing You Should Do for Your Prostate Every Morning**](http://t.latest.newsmax.com/r/?id=hb0bd6a81,5d3cf52,5d3ea2a&ns_mail_uid=3420339f-0929-45e8-ac85-ac75c22b145d&ns_mail_job=DM22883_04052019&s=acs&dkt_nbr=0101022kqi6b) --- **The Heart Surgeon’s Secret for Healthy Blood Pressure** **Famed heart surgeon reveals what he recommends to patients who want to keep their blood pressure in the healthy zone.** [![](http://images.newsmax.com/medix/ventricore2/images/ventricore- header.jpg)](http://t.latest.newsmax.com/r/?id=hb0bd6a81,5d3cf52,5d3ea2b&ns_mail_uid=3420339f-0929-45e8-ac85-ac75c22b145d&ns_mail_job=DM22883_04052019&s=acs&dkt_nbr=0101022kqi6b) **By Nancy Reynolds Reporting for Newsmax Health** Palm Beach Gardens, FL — “There’s a hidden reason why many people are still struggling with their blood pressure. And it may not be due to poor diet, lack of exercise, or too much salt.” When a famed heart surgeon utters these words, it’s worth sitting up and taking notice. That’s why we recently sat down with Dr. Chauncey Crandall to learn more about this missing link to healthy blood pressure. Dr. Crandall is chief of the Cardiac Transplant Program at the world-renowned Palm Beach Cardiovascular Clinic in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. Dr. Crandall is also author of the No. 1 Amazon best-seller _The Simple Heart Cure_ , and a frequent guest on national television and radio programs. “As a medical doctor and natural health advocate, I credit my own robust health to a balanced approach, including a good diet, daily exercise, and targeted supplements,” Dr. Crandall said. Why does Dr. Crandall feel so strongly about targeted supplements? I’ll tell you why in a moment. But first, let me tell you why you can no longer ignore this deadly health problem … **Silently Wreaking Havoc** If you’ve been told your blood pressure is higher than normal, then you are in serious danger. Unhealthy blood pressure is called the “silent killer.” That’s because it quietly sneaks up on you … damaging your blood vessels without causing pain … until it’s too late. Then disaster strikes in the form of a weakened heart, kidney problems, or perhaps circulation problems that can wreak havoc on your heart, brain, and eyes. 1 If left unchecked, unhealthy blood pressure, even in its mildest form, can lead to premature aging and serious brain damage. What’s more, half of all people who have been diagnosed with unhealthy blood pressure still don’t have it under control. **On a Mission to Help People With Stubborn Blood Pressure Problems** “There are literally millions of Americans who are still struggling with their blood pressure,” Dr. Crandall said. “Many people are already trying diets, exercise, maybe even taking medications. Yet they are still not getting their blood pressure to where it should be.” But there is a solution. “There are targeted nutrients that can help your body manage blood pressure naturally. But many people still don’t know about the extensive research behind them. “That’s why I’ve made it my mission to get this information out to people,” Dr. Crandall said. He then revealed … **The Nobel Prize-Winning Discovery That Can Finally Give You Hope** In 1998, three scientists stepped to the podium in Stockholm, Sweden, and accepted the Nobel Prize for Medicine.2![](http://images.newsmax.com/medix/ventricore2/email/nitric- quote.jpg) They had discovered a special molecule in the human body called _nitric oxide_. It was soon dubbed the “miracle molecule” for its amazing effect on blood pressure and circulation. Nitric oxide helps expand your blood vessels so more blood, oxygen, and nutrients can flow to every tiny capillary in your body. Doctors call this “vasodilation” but you’ll call it amazing. Hundreds of studies show nitric oxide helps: * **Relax arteries so they expand easily** , to promote optimal blood flow and healthy blood pressure. * **Maintain soft, elastic blood vessels** that support good cardiovascular health. * **Support a strong immune system**. Especially important during cold and flu season. * **Promote peak performance in the bedroom**. Nitric oxide plays a role in healthy erectile function. * **Boost energy**. Athletes use nitric oxide to get more oxygen flowing to their muscles. Weightlifters use it to get a serious boost! When your circulation is working well … just about every part of your body works better! But you can’t just go out and consume nitric oxide to get all these good things. Instead, your body produces a “precursor” — an amino acid called L‑arginine — that kick-starts this process. L‑arginine is converted into nitric oxide, which helps dilate your blood vessels. This, in turn, means your heart doesn’t have to pump as hard, which promotes normal blood pressure and circulation. | [![Regular artery vs Narrow artery](http://images.newsmax.com/medix/ventricore2/images/narrow-vs- wide.jpg)](http://t.latest.newsmax.com/r/?id=hb0bd6a81,5d3cf52,5d3ea2c&ns_mail_uid=3420339f-0929-45e8-ac85-ac75c22b145d&ns_mail_job=DM22883_04052019&s=acs&dkt_nbr=0101022kqi6b) --- **Vanishing L‑arginine** The trouble is, as you get older, your body produces less and less L‑arginine. In fact, your L‑arginine levels start to drop off as early as age 30. By the time you’re 50, chances are you’re not getting enough L‑arginine to keep your arteries relaxed and flexible. And that’s not all … **The Big Problem With L‑arginine** Ever since the discovery of nitric oxide and L‑arginine, companies have rushed to market L‑arginine supplements. ![](http://images.newsmax.com/medix/ventricore2/email/crandall-quote.jpg)But if you’ve ever tried one, chances are you’ve been disappointed with the results. Why? Because your body absorbs and metabolizes L‑arginine very quickly. So you’d have to take it _all day long_ just to get results. That is, until now … Now scientists have created a _sustained release_ form of L‑arginine that gives you a constant flow of L‑arginine all day long. It releases artery- relaxing L‑arginine continually for 24 hours. In fact, when researchers tested this new form of L‑arginine … it lived up to its promise. They noticed significant support for cardiovascular health in nearly seven out of 10 patients. And they noticed the difference in as little as seven days.3 So if you want to maintain normal blood pressure and get all the benefits of L‑arginine … sustained-release L‑arginine should be at the top of your list. That’s why Dr. Crandall recently teamed up with experts at Medix Select to create an advanced blood pressure formula with 3 grams of sustained-release L‑arginine called **Ventricore™**. But he didn’t stop there … because there are other nutrients that support healthy blood pressure and circulation. They include: ![Regular artery vs Narrow artery](http://images.newsmax.com/medix/ventricore2/images/ingredients5-mobile.jpg) --- I’ll tell you more about these nutrients in a moment. But first … Dr. Crandall believes so strongly in **Ventricore** that he has asked Medix Select to **reserve a 30-day supply just for you to try — at no risk**.

Crandall, M.D., F.A.C.C., is chief of the Cardiac Transplant Program at the world-renowned Palm Beach Cardiovascular Clinic in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where he practices interventional, vascular, and transplant cardiology. He is the author of the Amazon best-seller **The Simple Heart Cure** , and makes frequent guest appearances as a heart expert on national television and radio programs. He also lectures regularly, both nationally and internationally, about preventive cardiology, cardiology healthcare of the elderly, healing, interventional cardiology, and heart transplants. Dr. Crandall received his post-graduate training at Yale University School of Medicine, where he also completed three years of research in the Cardiovascular Surgery Division. --- **What About the 5 Other Ingredients in Ventricore?** Time-released L‑arginine is a good start for healthy blood pressure. But when you combine it with a few other circulation-boosting nutrients … . . . that’s when you REALLY have a chance to ”move the needle” at your next check-up! That’s why Dr. Crandall decided to include these five other ingredients in **Ventricore™**. **Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) — For Combating Free Radicals** Your body is under constant assault from pollution, toxins, harmful chemicals in food, and even waste products from normal metabolism. All these can lead to a build-up of nasty free radicals that can damage your cells. That’s why you need to neutralize free radicals as fast as possible. One of the best ways is with an antioxidant called alpha lipoic acid or ALA. ALA helps neutralize free radicals. It also helps your body recycle more of your master antioxidant, glutathione.5 And by the way … glutathione plays a role in your body’s ability to use nitric oxide for optimal blood flow.6 **Folic Acid — To Keep Your Homocysteine Levels in Check** You’ve probably heard of homocysteine. It’s one of the things your doctor checks on your regular blood tests. Homocysteine is a marker for inflammation that is associated with impaired heart health. Researchers have found that a B vitamin — folic acid — supports a better balance of homocysteine in your body. And folic acid works especially well when it’s combined with another B vitamin … **Vitamin B12 — To Get More Oxygen-Rich Blood to Every Cell in Your Body** ![](http://images.newsmax.com/medix/ventricore2/email/vitamin- round-B12-email.jpg) Like folic acid, vitamin B-12 also helps balance your levels of homocysteine. B12 is vital for healthy red blood cells as well. Increasing your red blood cells can boost the amount of oxygen that gets to your heart and muscles for more energy. B12 also enhances the ability of your cells to use nitric oxide generated by L‑arginine.7 And it protects the delicate lining around your nerves, which plays a role in regulating your blood pressure. But as we get older, we have a harder time absorbing B12 from our food. In fact, nearly two out of five Americans might not be getting enough B12.8 **Vitamin C — To Support Your Ability to Release Nitric Oxide** ![](http://images.newsmax.com/medix/ventricore2/email/vitamin-round-C- email.jpg) Like ALA, vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that fights free radicals. It also helps support your blood vessels’ ability to release nitric oxide, to promote blood flow and support healthy blood pressure. A study of young adult women found that those with the highest levels of vitamin C tended to have healthier blood pressure levels. In fact, a review of 29 different studies and 1,400 patients by researchers at Johns Hopkins University shows that vitamin C can have a clear effect on supporting healthy blood pressure. **Vitamin D — The Overlooked Vitamin for a Healthy Heart** ![](http://images.newsmax.com/medix/ventricore2/email/vitamin-round-D- email.jpg)Scientists now realize that vitamin D — yes, the sunshine vitamin! — plays a much bigger role in maintaining heart health than previously thought. For example, a study by Emory University looked at people with low levels of vitamin D. Researchers found that the lower your vitamin D, the less your blood vessels are able to relax. Vitamin D also plays a role in bone health, immune function, inflammatory response, and energy. Despite all this, most Americans still don’t get anywhere near the amount of vitamin D they should.9 That’s true even down in sunny Florida, where many of Dr. Crandall’s patients live. **‘The Targeted Blood Pressure Supplement I Trust More Than Any Other’** Dr. Crandall looked at many alternatives when it came to blood pressure supplements. He has yet to find one that matches the strategic blend of L‑arginine, folic acid, alpha lipoic acid (ALA), vitamin B12, vitamin C, and vitamin D found in **Ventricore**. He wanted to create a formula that covers all the bases when it comes to keeping your arteries healthy and supporting healthy circulation. And he wanted to make it affordable, too. That’s why he recommends **Ventricore** to everyone who wants to help maintain normal blood pressure — and that includes just about everyone over 40. But you don’t have to take our word for it because … **Satisfied Ventricore Users Say It Best!*** “. . . blood pressure under control …” “Ventricore helped put my blood pressure under control!” — Charles E., Janesville, WI “. . . within 30 days my blood pressure was normal …” “I had a very odd circumstance and ended up in the hospital.
