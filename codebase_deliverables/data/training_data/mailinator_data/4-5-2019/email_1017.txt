b'Blinkist Minute: A model you can subscribe to'
Blinkist Minute FRIDAY EDITION Hi there, Have you ever used Netflix or Spotify? What about one of those bike or car sharing apps that help people get around town? Well, all of the above are great examples of subscription-based business models - and you've probably noticed that they're taking the world by storm. Long gone are the days of having to leave the house to buy music or films. And having a car of your own - not to mention the pain of finding a parking spot - is becoming increasingly unnecessary. **Customers want the milk, not the cow** Consumers today care less about owning _things_ than having access to _services._ Our Blinkist service is a good case in point! Of course, switching over to a subscription-based business isn't going to be easy for everyone. Take Adobe, for example. In 2011, they decided to pivot away from selling their legendary - but expensive - creative software, such as Photoshop. Instead, Adobe announced they were moving to a monthly subscription service for their entire software suite. Initially, their stocks tanked, with investors wary of this huge shift in Adobe's key business model. But by 2014, the risk had already paid off, and Adobe's shares were trading for around double their pre-subscription model value. Subscription business models aren't just restricted to tech companies, though. To find out more on how you can benefit from the shift to a subscription-based business model, check out our blinks to **_Subscribed,_** **by Tien Tzuo.** Start reading Subscribed ( https://ablink.mail.blinkist.com/wf/click?upn=KpL1yTQz4ImjXiKwGiXYpnBOCHoA2lfcmjAms1evfc-2BkHylHWnEJdwuwE-2FmzJW-2F6tii13uSbAdNXH9v3FnQSCg-3D-3D_ezlM5VvemgdBsX5V73uSVLiO4pMMEqUo-2ByM2HtgR44m-2BC6l69i4XhRdkIjhT4o7WNDN4d91Jv37PjeYPgKU7N1mnDuWsxey5-2BQC8NjMDiUW0c4Fo25QxNUSo3h4ep50um6-2BwNYaEUVrvO8Ys-2F8GAfjuhRXY1LMjNlxsc-2B-2Bta-2FV4J07kzH-2BwirajkQv4N4RIAsG-2FWp9LAv37LjAEl75PyCp1w9ibVYlPXgTSn5KhX6eIKVGUlfdgfMHm0g5wDkuOsbvS6wEsRleM-2FuPK4qcI2LW2MeWQeTkGBtI2Znx5osNZ7hUcgduENss8w8Q5i4Meh-2FR5iHS2PerZJxY2MjADX2u05NUSOOx-2F22FMp14LjjKLUUNAnoPdEo-2B5dY4W6Z6nrQ2BKWq9ufaa7oShBYqDCBWlfBDURS6lI1TjxJOiSlzlmNyEsc9Pr3OPv3CQDZZwlifkQgaoFcm1fDAk13E6oMdBBBcnRrvWwvLFPYSGnlXNaww-2FhvTXvzedBEJWX73RvBfNhMNk9YwtisGIjY98FX-2Bi27vgGptZWeurYeqGlqm0-3D ) Blinkist Copyright © 2019 Blinks Labs GmbH, Sonnenallee 223, 12059 Berlin, Germany | hello@blinkist.com Not interested in e-mail updates?
