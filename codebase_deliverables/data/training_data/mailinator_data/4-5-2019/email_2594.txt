b'Lead Generation Guide'
Hey Test, We've created a B2B Lead Generation guide over at Jeffalytics that you will find interesting if you provide professional services. This guide is specifically geared toward service providers looking to bring in more leads for their business in a consistent and scalable way. But, of course, all of you are welcome to check out the post. Today, I am sharing the process I’ve used as a freelancer, agency owner, and instructor to overcome my business development problems. You can use it, too! In this post and video on Jeffalytics, you can follow along with my process. You can also download my Growth Projections Calculator. This calculator will help you clearly determine what you want your business to accomplish, and what it’s going to take to get there. Check out today's post.
